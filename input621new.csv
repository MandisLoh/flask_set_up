"
Change of Name for the ISTD Degree Programme," Students,

 

SUTD will be changing the name of its degree programme from the Bachelor of Engineering (Information Systems Technology and Design) to Bachelor of Engineering (puter Science and Design). Ts name change will take effect from the graduating class of 2021 and will also affect the Minor programme. 

 

The decision to change the programme name to Ã¢â‚¬Å“puter Science and Design (CSD)Ã¢â‚¬Â aims to accurately reflect the interdisciplinary nature of the puting-intensive coupled with design curriculum that students have undergone in the ISTD pillar. Multiple discussions with various stakeholders such as alumni, current students, faculty and industry also ghlighted strong reasons in support of ts change.

 

In a survey of 177 participants from the stakeholder groups, 83% of them were in favour of renaming it Ã¢â‚¬Å“puter Science and Design (CSD)Ã¢â‚¬Â.

The curriculum of the CSD degree programme will remain essentially unchanged and is still accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Board (EAB). 

ISTD will continue to retain its pillar name at the Pillar level as it extensively covers general topics related to information systems and puter science.

 

Thank you for your attention.

 

Your sincerely,

Tony

 Sumbul,

 

Thank you for the update.

 

Firstly, regarding copyright page Ã¢â‚¬â€œ yes, the authors should maintain the copyright of their stories. Regarding the wording of the same on the page, among others points, we are not too sure about it. I am attacng a version here where we have done some amendments to the copyright page and the preface but would request you to please get it vet from someone in your team who is qualified to verify the language for the copyright page. 

 

Secondly, I am attacng two documents, one for the cover page and one for the section divider page (pagination page for the stories) for you to adapt. Am attacng them in both word and in pdf for you to be able to visualize how it will look. For the Section Divider, I would remend to keep the visual elements as well.

 

Trdly, regarding your other requests/doubts, I have created a doc wch am attacng here as a reference guide for team.

 

I hope the details will be clear and if not, please do let me know!

 

Thanks,

Parul

 Parul, Sheena,

 

Just to update you, we have received confirmations from close to 75 people. Around 10 people haven't responded to the email, we are reacng out to them separately through their institutes. 

 

We have also incorporated the changes suggested by the contributors and D. 

 

The following issues remain: 

1.	Please help us with a template/ brand guide/ sample heading styles as requested below. We need ts so we can implement the changes quickly as desired by D, and avoid unnecessary back and forth over font styles. 
2.	Please confirm if authors would retain copyright to their stories. 

Thanks

Sumbul

Great speaking to you. I have attached a Word file of the Ebook. 

 

Here's my undersding of the decisions & requests for samples, wch would help us in quickly implementing the changes: 

*	All changes in Preface & front matter: I have attached the word file with the preface and front matter. Please feel free to make requisite edits.  
*	Please use a gh-res D logo: Please help us with a gh-res D logo 
*	I had remended a Cover Page/ an Illustration for the  E-book. Can it still be explored? Please help us with a Word editable version of the Cover page. 
*	Subheads witn stories should be sentence-cased. Please help us with a sample. 
*	All titles should be initial caps. Please help us with a sample. 
*	Images witn the same story, if possible, should ideally be of the same dimensions, especially if tÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re placed side by side; images should also align with column widths as much as possible. We can try to adjust the images a bit, but can't promise, as the original images might have underlng issues. We will crop/ adjust wherever possible. Please help us with the new images that you mentioned. 
*	Remove all image credits (should be quite self-explanatory that the images originated from the respective sources/authors); You can either change Ã¢â‚¬Å“FigureÃ¢â‚¬Â to Ã¢â‚¬Å“ImageÃ¢â‚¬Â if t are Ã¢â‚¬Å“ImagesÃ¢â‚¬Â and  drawings or illustrations be Ã¢â‚¬Å“FigureÃ¢â‚¬Â. However, you can also remove all the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Figure 1Ã¢â‚¬Â, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Figure 2Ã¢â‚¬Â etc at the start of each caption as itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s obvious the captions are for the acpanng photos. OK, please help us with the sentence you want for image credits. 
*	Having pull-out quotes is good Ã¢â‚¬â€œ suggest to have them in all stories to break the monotony (especially so for those stories without any photos). We agreed that we will keep current pagination & layout (pull out quotes in all stories will lead to spill over). 
*	A lot of the photos appear at the end of each story wch isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t ideal. Would it be possible to better feature them earlier on in the story, e.g. when itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first mentioned, so readers can reference to them and it makes for a more engaging story, instead of just text. We will try to acmodate as much as possible. 
*	Also, we would like to propose a joint ownersp i.e. both SUTD and D for the E-book as per www.artsresourcehub.gov./legal-support/intellectual-property-copyright#:~:text=In%20joint%20copyright%20ownersp%2C%20each,creation%20of%20ts%20joint%20work <apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook/?url=%3A%2F%2Fwww.artsresourcehub.gov.%2Flegal-support%2Fintellectual-property-copyright%23%3A~%3Atext%3DIn%2520joint%2520copyright%2520ownersp%252C%2520each%2Ccreation%2520of%2520ts%2520joint%2520work&data=04%7C01%7C_%40.sutd..%7C19c1107836f14ea2cdc208d952706da6%7C3476b776e9904f72b95062489831623d%7C0%7C0%7C637631465898902569%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=O64TIj4cTfLkeSczoEf8mX02FNb95SU7n4hOmzNaP94%3D&reserved=0> . Please help us with the sentence you'd like us to insert in the copyright page. 
	
	
*	We will go with the map that we currently have as it is based on D template. 
*	QR codes have been used as 'fillers' in wte space, we will create links wherever possible. 
*	We will update TOC for greater readability. 
*

 Sumbul,

 

We have gone through the PDF and collated our ments. Most of them have been added witn the doc itself but sharing some over-arcng points here as well. Also, will SUTD be proof-reading the stories once the contributors confirm and give their consent as well. We too of course will be doing with the same.

 

Here are some pointers:

*	All copy should be British spelling; spell out one to nine
*	Subheads witn stories should be sentence-cased
*	All titles should be initial caps
*	Images witn the same story, if possible, should ideally be of the same dimensions, especially if tÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re placed side by side; images should also align with column widths as much as possible
*	Remove all image credits (should be quite self-explanatory that the images originated from the respective sources/authors); You can either change Ã¢â‚¬Å“FigureÃ¢â‚¬Â to Ã¢â‚¬Å“ImageÃ¢â‚¬Â if t are Ã¢â‚¬Å“ImagesÃ¢â‚¬Â and  drawings or illustrations be Ã¢â‚¬Å“FigureÃ¢â‚¬Â. However, you can also remove all the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Figure 1Ã¢â‚¬Â, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Figure 2Ã¢â‚¬Â etc at the start of each caption as itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s obvious the captions are for the acpanng photos
*	Having pull-out quotes is good Ã¢â‚¬â€œ suggest to have them in all stories to break the monotony (especially so for those stories without any photos)
*	A lot of the photos appear at the end of each story wch isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t ideal. Would it be possible to better feature them earlier on in the story, e.g. when itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first mentioned, so readers can reference to them and it makes for a more engaging story, instead of just text.

Thank you for your mitment and contributions serving as Student Exco members over the past Term 1 and 2. We hope you have an enjoyable and  enricng experience in taking up the student leadersp position in SUTD . 

 

With the adoption of the new academic calendar in wch  Term 1 and Term 3 are overlapped in the Fall Term, and the regrouping of the  Term 3 students into new different cohorts according to your choice of the elective subjects under the new  curriculum, it is necessary to make certain revisions on the Student Exco Programme and  Cohort Advisor Programme accordingly to better adapt to these changes without promising to your learning experience and growth during your  journey.

 

Revisions of Student Exco and Cohort Advisor programmes for Term 3 effective from Sept 2021:

 

1.       Cohort Advisor will serve only the first two terms, i.e. Term 1 and Term 2, not in Term 3.

 

2.       Student Exco of each cohort group will only be formed in Term 1 and Term 2, not in Term 3.

In Term 3, Office of Undergraduate Studies (UGS) will work with you to identify 2 to 3 student reps from each new cohort group, either by nomination or self-nomination, to manage the cohort classroom facilities and resources, such as the library books, AV system, stationery and etc, and UGS will take care of the  Term 3 studentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ welfare in the areas of cohort classroom logistics matters.

 

3.	Keep the Best Class Spirit Award of $300 to be awarded after Term 2.

 

4.       Retain the cohort funding of $250 in Term 3. Funding utilization is subject to the UGS approval.

 

5.	Discontinue the Cleanest Cohort Classroom Award in Term 3.

 

6.	Discontinue the Cohort Classroom Design petition.

 

 

Thanks.

Thank you for looking into ts program! I've taken note of the tentative dates from 20-24 December 2021, we can finalise the date when more details are being firmed up.

The P3 & P4 class size is 21 pax & 13 pax respectively. On our end, we are alright for the on-site engagement to still carry on with ts age group, though unvaccinated. 
Thank you for giving us the assurance that your team will be fully vaccinated by then!

Looking at the current cases & safe discing measures, it is good to have an online schle planned out like what your team initiated. 
In view of that, may I please suggest that your team propose a cut-off date for us to make a decision on whether we should proceed with an on-site or online program regardless of future changes in the safe discing measures? Ts is to ensure that there is sufficient time for both parties adjust the program & getting the attendance of the cldren.

The general safe discing measures that we have in our centre as of now a

- No more than 5 pax per group for activities/discussion, including students & volunteers
- Classes of different levels are not allowed to mingle 
- To try our best to maintain 1 metre disce between individuals & groups 

As the detailed safe discing measures may change frequently, above are some basic general guidelines for us to follow. If there is anytng else to add on along the way, I will keep you updated. Hope ts clarifies!

Please feel free to contact me if more clarification is needed! Thank you.

 Geraldine,  

 

ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s some really great news! Looking forward to working with your team.  

 

After much discussion with my team, we are likely to organize the program on either of these dates, 20-24 December 2021, after our finals examination. In addition, we are looking into designing the program for P3 and/or P4 students. A query we have would be that is it possible to plan activities for ts age group, as t cannot be vaccinated? If possible, may we know the cohort size for P3 and P4 respectively? If itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not encouraged, would changing our target group to above 12 years old be more suitable? On our side, please rest assured that my team will be fully vaccinated by then.  

 

As much as we love to organize an on-site activity, we would plan an online schle as well in case of any sudden wave of infection (touchwood!). Is it possible to share with us some safe management measures that you observe so that we can include similar measures in the proposal?  

 

Thank you so much and hope to hear from you soon!  

 

Have a great day!

Thank you for expressing your interest in partnering Bethesda Care Services, Sunsne Club Student Care Centre! We are glad to hear from you on the potential volunteering opportunity, and we are definitely keen to partner with you be it on-site or online in accordance to the safe management measures.


The idea of blending Christmas with being environmentally friendly sounds great, with a mix of fun and interactive activities.


For a start, our centre consists of approximately 100 cldren, ranging from P1 to Sec 2, age 7 to 14 years old. We have 6 staff-in-charge for the respective classes. May I please ask if there is a specific age group you are looking at?


I undersd that there are no fixed plans as of now as it is still quite some time away from Christmas. We can discuss along the way when more ideas are generated!

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you've further queries.

 Parul, Sheena

 

Great speaking to you. I have attached a Word file of the Ebook. 

 

Here's my undersding of the decisions & requests for samples, wch would help us in quickly implementing the changes: 

*	All changes in Preface & front matter: I have attached the word file with the preface and front matter. Please feel free to make requisite edits.  
*	Please use a gh-res D logo: Please help us with a gh-res D logo 
*	I had remended a Cover Page/ an Illustration for the  E-book. Can it still be explored? Please help us with a Word editable version of the Cover page. 
*	Subheads witn stories should be sentence-cased. Please help us with a sample. 
*	All titles should be initial caps. Please help us with a sample. 
*	Images witn the same story, if possible, should ideally be of the same dimensions, especially if tÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re placed side by side; images should also align with column widths as much as possible. We can try to adjust the images a bit, but can't promise, as the original images might have underlng issues. We will crop/ adjust wherever possible. Please help us with the new images that you mentioned. 
*	Remove all image credits (should be quite self-explanatory that the images originated from the respective sources/authors); You can either change Ã¢â‚¬Å“FigureÃ¢â‚¬Â to Ã¢â‚¬Å“ImageÃ¢â‚¬Â if t are Ã¢â‚¬Å“ImagesÃ¢â‚¬Â and  drawings or illustrations be Ã¢â‚¬Å“FigureÃ¢â‚¬Â. However, you can also remove all the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Figure 1Ã¢â‚¬Â, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Figure 2Ã¢â‚¬Â etc at the start of each caption as itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s obvious the captions are for the acpanng photos. OK, please help us with the sentence you want for image credits. 
*	Having pull-out quotes is good Ã¢â‚¬â€œ suggest to have them in all stories to break the monotony (especially so for those stories without any photos). We agreed that we will keep current pagination & layout (pull out quotes in all stories will lead to spill over). 
*	A lot of the photos appear at the end of each story wch isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t ideal. Would it be possible to better feature them earlier on in the story, e.g. when itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first mentioned, so readers can reference to them and it makes for a more engaging story, instead of just text. We will try to acmodate as much as possible. 
*	Also, we would like to propose a joint ownersp i.e. both SUTD and D for the E-book as per www.artsresourcehub.gov./legal-support/intellectual-property-copyright#:~:text=In%20joint%20copyright%20ownersp%2C%20each,creation%20of%20ts%20joint%20work <apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook/?url=%3A%2F%2Fwww.artsresourcehub.gov.%2Flegal-support%2Fintellectual-property-copyright%23%3A~%3Atext%3DIn%2520joint%2520copyright%2520ownersp%252C%2520each%2Ccreation%2520of%2520ts%2520joint%2520work&data=04%7C01%7C_%40.sutd..%7C153f43f0145d4d7f7fcb08d94c57e5ab%7C3476b776e9904f72b95062489831623d%7C0%7C0%7C637624762985274120%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=Bgcnhe3C7b8B%2BMaoD%2F4XBXkajGYNRJUBcpskRtMLSeQ%3D&reserved=0> . Please help us with the sentence you'd like us to insert in the copyright page. 
*	We will go with the map that we currently have as it is based on D template. 
*	QR codes have been used as 'fillers' in wte space, we will create links wherever possible. 
*	We will update TOC for greater readability.

 Sumbul,

 

We have gone through the PDF and collated our ments. Most of them have been added witn the doc itself but sharing some over-arcng points here as well. Also, will SUTD be proof-reading the stories once the contributors confirm and give their consent as well. We too of course will be doing with the same.

 

Here are some pointers:

*	All copy should be British spelling; spell out one to nine
*	Subheads witn stories should be sentence-cased
*	All titles should be initial caps
*	Images witn the same story, if possible, should ideally be of the same dimensions, especially if tÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re placed side by side; images should also align with column widths as much as possible
*	Remove all image credits (should be quite self-explanatory that the images originated from the respective sources/authors); You can either change Ã¢â‚¬Å“FigureÃ¢â‚¬Â to Ã¢â‚¬Å“ImageÃ¢â‚¬Â if t are Ã¢â‚¬Å“ImagesÃ¢â‚¬Â and  drawings or illustrations be Ã¢â‚¬Å“FigureÃ¢â‚¬Â. However, you can also remove all the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Figure 1Ã¢â‚¬Â, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Figure 2Ã¢â‚¬Â etc at the start of each caption as itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s obvious the captions are for the acpanng photos
*	Having pull-out quotes is good Ã¢â‚¬â€œ suggest to have them in all stories to break the monotony (especially so for those stories without any photos)
*	A lot of the photos appear at the end of each story wch isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t ideal. Would it be possible to better feature them earlier on in the story, e.g. when itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first mentioned, so readers can reference to them and it makes for a more engaging story, instead of just text.

 Sumbul,

 

Thank you for the draft. We are in principle ok but do have a few suggestions on some of the details. We are still collating them from a couple of our team members. However, we are not yet proof reading the stories. We would like to do that post you sharing and having received back the proofs from the contributors. Hence, if you want to proceed with that you may and I will also send our ments before the end of ts week.

 

Once you have received the proofs from the contributors, we can go through it again for final approval.

 

Let me know your thoughts.

 

Thank you,

Parul

I am pleased to attach the current draft of the Call for Stories Ebook. 

*	Stories have been basic grammar checked, proof-read, and adjusted to fit in the template. 
*	We have edited some stories (largely the student stories, and those from overseas) to improve the coherence. 
*	We have removed three stories, as those were invalid entries. 
*	We have adapted the Preface sent by D. 

We need the following from you:

1.	List of D personnel to be included in the acknowledgements page
2.	Input into the ""Copyright"" page. 

Best, 

Sumbul

Apologies for the late reply, your email somehow went buried amongst the rest of them in my inbox Ã°Å¸ËœÅ . Sure, thanks for your initial interest in ts UROP. Your summary is pretty decent, probably it would benefit from more details and more in-depth analyses. Nevertheless, it was a good job.

 

Thanks and all the best!

 Quin,

 

Really sorry for the late email, as well as submission.

 

IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve attached the summary IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve written for the given research paper. 

 

After much consideration, I decide to give ts valuable opportunity a miss. However, it would be a bonus if I could hear from you on what could be improved on the summary for future improvements. 

 

Hope to be able to work with you in the future instead and see you around in school!

 

Stay safe Ã°Å¸â„¢â€š

 

Yours sincerely,

 ,

 

Thank you for taking the time to have a little chat with us today regarding your UROP application. As the UROP demands the ability of the student to read and distill key findings of journal articles (and possible book articles), we would like to have a quick undersding of your propensity to undertake the task. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve attached a brief article on entrepreneurial traits. Could you kindly read the article and submit to me an approximately 500-word summary of it by the end of Thursday 13 May? The summary should include an introduction, methods, results, discussion/conclusion, and your brief critical analysis of the article.

 

Please feel free to ask me any questions that you may have.  Look forward to receiving your summary soon!

 

Thanks!

	! 

	First of all, I would like to apologize sincerely for sending ts application late as I was considering really thoroughly. After much thought, I decided that I would like to join ts program and thus applng for it, wch links me to the first question. Hope you would still give ts application a read, thank you!

	1.Why do you want to join the program? (Max 100 words) 
	14 months ago, I was hesitating between SMU Business and SUTD. Though ing into SUTD is a great decision, there's still some regret in me for not studng business. As such, I'm intending to pursue a business-related Masters's instead. Filled with lots of great resources, like mentorsp and the opportunity to work on case studies, ts program is one step closer to my dream and fulfilling it earlier. So, why not? University to me is about self-exploration and preparing me for the real world ahead. I genuinely hope to be enrolled in ts to enrich my learning journey in SUTD. 

	2.What career do you wish to pursue? (Max 100 words)
	
	To be very truthful, I don't have a specific answer as I'm not sure what lies ahead of me. However, the concept of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data attracts me and I'm intending to pursue a degree in DAI or ESD. Subsequently, I may find a career related to Business analytic, AI-related developer, or designer. Once, I read about specialists vs generalists. Greedy as I am, I wish for myself to be a 'T-shaped' person, one filled with the breadth of knowledge and depth of expertise. On top of learning new skills, I wish to be enrolled in ts program.

	Thank you for taking the time out of your busy schle to read ts and hope to hear from you soon Ã°Å¸â„¢â€š

 Sharing of  Experience on SMT Newsletter

 

 Eng ng! 

 

Joseph shared with me regarding the SMT Newsletter, and I would love to be part of it! As the class will be split based on electives in Term 3, I was tnking of an article dedicating to F05 before we proceed to our new classes. However, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not sure if ts topic would be possible. I could write about my  experience in general if you would prefer that as well. 

 

In addition, I saw the previous newsletter and noticed that some articles wrote from the 3rd POV wle some used the Q&A method. Wch kind of style should I be using? Apart from the 300 word limit, are there other restrictions like number of images and number of points I should be mentioning?

 

Thank you!

  Action Required: Concur Expense Claim Pending Your Approval

 

 Sea Ming,

 

Sorry for the delayed response as IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been really busy these days. Please do undersd me for not being able to give immediate response.

 

The problem IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m facing here is that DBS statement es out every second week of the month, wch means my payment on 12 August will only be displayed in the September statement, wch I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have it now. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve tried to find ways to request but to no avail. Please do advice me accordingly on ts. 

 

My sister has remended me to show that the bank account is indeed mine by attacng my previous bank statement. Thus, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have the purchase record, my name and bank account. 

 

Hope ts is good and I will resubmit on concur. 

 

Also, due to the inclusiveness of GST and gher conversion rate, my claimed amount ($80.88) is gher than the request amount $73+, wch I obtained by just converting USD53 to D. Hope you could return me $80.88 instead.

 

Thank you!

 

Yours sincerely,

 Sea Ming,

 

Sorry for the delayed response as IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been really busy these days. Please do undersd me for not being able to give immediate response.

 

The problem IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m facing here is that DBS statement es out every second week of the month, wch means my payment on 12 August will only be displayed in the September statement, wch I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have it now. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve tried to find ways to request but to no avail. Please do advice me accordingly on ts. 

 

My sister has remended me to show that the bank account is indeed mine by attacng my previous bank statement. Thus, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have the purchase record, my name and bank account. 

 

Hope ts is good and I will resubmit on concur. 

 

Also, due to the inclusiveness of GST and gher conversion rate, my claimed amount ($80.88) is gher than the request amount $73+, wch I obtained by just converting USD53 to D. Hope you could return me $80.88 instead.

 

Thank you!

		First of all, I would like to apologize sincerely for sending ts application late as I was considering really thoroughly. After much thought, I decided that I would like to join ts program and thus applng for it, wch links me to the first question. Hope you would still give ts application a read, thank you!

		1.Why do you want to join the program? (Max 100 words) 
		14 months ago, I was hesitating between SMU Business and SUTD. Though ing into SUTD is a great decision, there's still some regret in me for not studng business. As such, I'm intending to pursue a business-related Masters's instead. Filled with lots of great resources, like mentorsp and the opportunity to work on case studies, ts program is one step closer to my dream and fulfilling it earlier. So, why not? University to me is about self-exploration and preparing me for the real world ahead. I genuinely hope to be enrolled in ts to enrich my learning journey in SUTD. 

		2.What career do you wish to pursue? (Max 100 words)
		
		To be very truthful, I don't have a specific answer as I'm not sure what lies ahead of me. However, the concept of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data attracts me and I'm intending to pursue a degree in DAI or ESD. Subsequently, I may find a career related to Business analytic, AI-related developer, or designer. Once, I read about specialists vs generalists. Greedy as I am, I wish for myself to be a 'T-shaped' person, one filled with the breadth of knowledge and depth of expertise. On top of learning new skills, I wish to be enrolled in ts program.

		Thank you for taking the time out of your busy schle to read ts and hope to hear from you soon Ã°Å¸â„¢â€š

Hooray! You guys are the best class and congratulations on winning the best class spirit award and thank you on behalf of the class for writing up the submission :) And I tnk your article came at the perfect timing to memorate F05. The video is so cute, love seeing everyone faces there. 

 

I sincerely appreciate your time in writing up the article. For you information, SMT is a cluster consist most of the  subjects as well as few minor program in the upper year too. Unfortunately for the first 2 term, 3.007 course is not part of SMT. I include the link here for your reference: smt.sutd../cation/undergraduate/courses/. Since your article will be published in SMT newsletter, I thought it will be nice (if any) to showcase any SMT relevant subjects or faculty too? Ts is just my opinion so that your experience is share at the right platform. I will help you check if your message to 3.007 course and faculty could be publish in another newsletter. I am sure t will be more than happy to have your experience share there too. Let me know if that is ok with you. 

 

Please let me know if you have any other query, will try my best to response to you promptly.

 

Thank you so much

I would be delighted for you to share your experience as a  student, can be anytng really. ghlighted events, what you enjoy most in the first two terms (subject wise, the curriculum, SMT subject, schooling in the pandemic period etc, just some suggestion) and of course you can dedicate your words to F05 as well. 

 

Choose any style or format you want to present, the choice is yours :) The word limit is just an indication of how much we can fit into one page and send me the original photos, as many that you tnk can fit into one page including caption.

 Eng ng! 

 

Joseph shared with me regarding the SMT Newsletter, and I would love to be part of it! As the class will be split based on electives in Term 3, I was tnking of an article dedicating to F05 before we proceed to our new classes. However, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not sure if ts topic would be possible. I could write about my  experience in general if you would prefer that as well. 

 

In addition, I saw the previous newsletter and noticed that some articles wrote from the 3rd POV wle some used the Q&A method. Wch kind of style should I be using? Apart from the 300 word limit, are there other restrictions like number of images and number of points I should be mentioning?

 

Thank you!

 

Yours sincerely,

 Sharing of  Experience on SMT Newsletter

 

 Eng ng! 

 

Joseph shared with me regarding the SMT Newsletter, and I would love to be part of it! As the class will be split based on electives in Term 3, I was tnking of an article dedicating to F05 before we proceed to our new classes. However, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not sure if ts topic would be possible. I could write about my  experience in general if you would prefer that as well. 

 

In addition, I saw the previous newsletter and noticed that some articles wrote from the 3rd POV wle some used the Q&A method. Wch kind of style should I be using? Apart from the 300 word limit, are there other restrictions like number of images and number of points I should be mentioning?

 

Thank you!

 

Yours sincerely,

				! 

				 

				First of all, I would like to apologize sincerely for sending ts application late as I was considering really thoroughly. After much thought, I decided that I would like to join ts program and thus applng for it, wch links me to the first question. Hope you would still give ts application a read, thank you!

				 

				1.Why do you want to join the program? (Max 100 words) 

				14 months ago, I was hesitating between SMU Business and SUTD. Though ing into SUTD is a great decision, there's still some regret in me for not studng business. As such, I'm intending to pursue a business-related Masters's instead. Filled with lots of great resources, like mentorsp and the opportunity to work on case studies, ts program is one step closer to my dream and fulfilling it earlier. So, why not? University to me is about self-exploration and preparing me for the real world ahead. I genuinely hope to be enrolled in ts to enrich my learning journey in SUTD. 

				 

				2.What career do you wish to pursue? (Max 100 words)

				To be very truthful, I don't have a specific answer as I'm not sure what lies ahead of me. However, the concept of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data attracts me and I'm intending to pursue a degree in DAI or ESD. Subsequently, I may find a career related to Business analytic, AI-related developer, or designer. Once, I read about specialists vs generalists. Greedy as I am, I wish for myself to be a 'T-shaped' person, one filled with the breadth of knowledge and depth of expertise. On top of learning new skills, I wish to be enrolled in ts program.

				 

				Thank you for taking the time out of your busy schle to read ts and hope to hear from you soon Ã°Å¸â„¢â€š

We would require assisce to record whenever the teams are in Breakout Rooms. The Zoom recordings do take a wle to convert if the recording is too long, so a suggestion would be to stop the recording during your lunch/dinner breaks and resume recording during the discussions.

 

I will be recording the main Zoom room lectures, hence you are not required to record during those times.

 

Do feel free to let me know if there are any issues accessing the link, or if there are any questions. I must apologize that there has been some ccups/last min changes today as we started Day 1 of ts virtual programme.. I hope everyone is able to have fun and enjoy the rest of the programme in the next 3 days. Ã°Å¸ËœÅ

Hooray! You guys are the best class and congratulations on winning the best class spirit award and thank you on behalf of the class for writing up the submission :) And I tnk your article came at the perfect timing to memorate F05. The video is so cute, love seeing everyone faces there. 

 

I sincerely appreciate your time in writing up the article. For you information, SMT is a cluster consist most of the  subjects as well as few minor program in the upper year too. Unfortunately for the first 2 term, 3.007 course is not part of SMT. I include the link here for your reference: smt.sutd../cation/undergraduate/courses/. Since your article will be published in SMT newsletter, I thought it will be nice (if any) to showcase any SMT relevant subjects or faculty too? Ts is just my opinion so that your experience is share at the right platform. I will help you check if your message to 3.007 course and faculty could be publish in another newsletter. I am sure t will be more than happy to have your experience share there too. Let me know if that is ok with you. 

 

Please let me know if you have any other query, will try my best to response to you promptly.

Hooray! You guys are the best class and congratulations on winning the best class spirit award and thank you on behalf of the class for writing up the submission :) And I tnk your article came at the perfect timing to memorate F05. The video is so cute, love seeing everyone faces there. 

 

I sincerely appreciate your time in writing up the article. For you information, SMT is a cluster consist most of the  subjects as well as few minor program in the upper year too. Unfortunately for the first 2 term, 3.007 course is not part of SMT. I include the link here for your reference: smt.sutd../cation/undergraduate/courses/. Since your article will be published in SMT newsletter, I thought it will be nice (if any) to showcase any SMT relevant subjects or faculty too? Ts is just my opinion so that your experience is share at the right platform. I will help you check if your message to 3.007 course and faculty could be publish in another newsletter. I am sure t will be more than happy to have your experience share there too. Let me know if that is ok with you. 

 

Please let me know if you have any other query, will try my best to response to you promptly.

 

Thank you so much

 

Cheers,

 Sharing of  Experience on SMT Newsletter

 

 Eng ng! 

 

Joseph shared with me regarding the SMT Newsletter, and I would love to be part of it! As the class will be split based on electives in Term 3, I was tnking of an article dedicating to F05 before we proceed to our new classes. However, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not sure if ts topic would be possible. I could write about my  experience in general if you would prefer that as well. 

 

In addition, I saw the previous newsletter and noticed that some articles wrote from the 3rd POV wle some used the Q&A method. Wch kind of style should I be using? Apart from the 300 word limit, are there other restrictions like number of images and number of points I should be mentioning?

 

Thank you!

 

Yours sincerely,

 [Virtual FACT 2021 - DTIxSZTU] Shared Folder for Presentation Materials & Zoom Breakout Room Recordings

 

 Everyone,

 

I have created a shared folder HERE <apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook/?url=%3A%2F%2Fsutdapac-my.sharepoint%2F%3Af%3A%2Fg%2Fpersonal%2Ftszwing_law_sutd__%2FEjpMeJweoKZJlnzRd-GrfYYBuO86Yb4nroLkkO9_oeC6ZQ%3Fe%3DzZ9Qmw&data=04%7C01%7C_%40.sutd..%7Cd4a1926957ee40a38aef08d96f8fbd02%7C3476b776e9904f72b95062489831623d%7C0%7C0%7C637663485408497034%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=xrZHWXtQZBbRQ1Lzti76AhSnTHlQ%2Fdc7z8c%2B%2BvzsJeY%3D&reserved=0>  for me to share materials from Prof Arlindo (if any) with you, and for you to drop the Zoom Breakout Room recordings.

 

We would require assisce to record whenever the teams are in Breakout Rooms. The Zoom recordings do take a wle to convert if the recording is too long, so a suggestion would be to stop the recording during your lunch/dinner breaks and resume recording during the discussions.

 

I will be recording the main Zoom room lectures, hence you are not required to record during those times.

 

Do feel free to let me know if there are any issues accessing the link, or if there are any questions. I must apologize that there has been some ccups/last min changes today as we started Day 1 of ts virtual programme.. I hope everyone is able to have fun and enjoy the rest of the programme in the next 3 days. Ã°Å¸ËœÅ

[Restricted] Seating Plan for Cohort 20F08,"Message Classification: Restricted

 

 

 Students,

Wele back to SUTD!

A collaborative and cooperative culture is one of the key traits that keep the SUTD munity spirit strong. 

Cohort-based learning

In our cohort-based pedagogy that emphasises peer learning, you will continue to be assigned randomly to groups and work with new people.

Seating Plan

Term 3 starts on 13 September (Monday) and we would like to provide information of your seat number and seating plan.  Please refer to the attached PDF.

As part of the safe management measures, please minimise your interactions by working with the assigned group of no more than 5 persons and occupng the assigned seat for lessons. Please refer to other measures shared in the attached email: Notice for Students (26 August 2021).

Some of your cohort/group mates may not be able to join you at the start of the term as t are serving SHN or entering Singapore later. As their buddies, you can:

*	Provide the Affected International Students (AIS) with opportunities of digital socialisation inside and outside classroom (e.g. 5th row) to instil a sense of belonging and camaraderie 
*	Provide the AIS with peer support in learning 
*	ghlight potential issues/challenges encountered in group projects, if any to course instructors.

 

Thank you.

Ã¢â„¢â€ Finale Tournament Sign-Ups: THE SUTD WEEK OF CHESS Ã¢â„¢Å¡," all,

SUTD Chess conducted a Beginner Crash Course <apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook/?url=%3A%2F%2Fwww.twitch.tv%2Fvideos%2F1149125476&data=04%7C01%7C_%40.sutd..%7Cefb8c8f5a8e3468ef4f608d978073f00%7C3476b776e9904f72b95062489831623d%7C0%7C0%7C637672794997483378%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=nMhHQqF5BrGDQZId2%2BX4n1jaakWH7XC7Z7%2B246n6VLw%3D&reserved=0>  yesterday for the SUTD Week Of Chess.

However, as I was telling the participants in the Beginner Crash Course yesterday, I really tnk that you should join the tournament even if you don't tnk you will do well. Remember that ability in chess is not an indicator of intelligence - chess is just a game, and like any other game, one gets better by plang more and developing pattern recognition. Nobody is going to judge you for losing games - every single chess player has lost countless.




I only started plang last December, after being inspired by The Queen's Gambit. I lost every single game in my first tournament (NUS Invitational 2021), but it was still one of the best learning experiences I've had. Since then, I've managed to score a decent 5 points out of 11 games at the more recent Jurong Spring National Day Blitz Championsp. The master has lost more games than the beginner has ever played, and the only way to get better is to put yourself out there to gain more experience. 




If you already signed up for the club and didn't register for the tournament, but have now changed your mind, you can use ts form <apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook/?url=%3A%2F%2Fforms.office%2Fr%2Fgi1FYyRFWn&data=04%7C01%7C_%40.sutd..%7Cefb8c8f5a8e3468ef4f608d978073f00%7C3476b776e9904f72b95062489831623d%7C0%7C0%7C637672794997523331%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=Pd2zaeLsFpzIxmkZdCOs430GBGGpAwgVRYusr%2BAcc%3D&reserved=0>  to register for the tournament now!




If you really do still feel not very confident about plang in the main tournament, you can join ts beginner tournament <apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook/?url=%3A%2F%2Flichess.org%2Ftournament%2FG5DxePik&data=04%7C01%7C_%40.sutd..%7Cefb8c8f5a8e3468ef4f608d978073f00%7C3476b776e9904f72b95062489831623d%7C0%7C0%7C637672794997523331%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=R%2Fenf%2FBwPPXodh%2Bzwe4WVt8iJxzKSPSvYoEbjaMxcoo%3D&reserved=0>  instead that runs at the same time as the main tournament. There are no prizes for ts one - it's just a low-stakes way for you to get more experience.




Finally, if you've been impressed by the Week Of Chess so far, do join SUTD Chess by filling up ts form <apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook/?url=%3A%2F%2Fforms.office%2Fr%2FATTBDvFTuT&data=04%7C01%7C_%40.sutd..%7Cefb8c8f5a8e3468ef4f608d978073f00%7C3476b776e9904f72b95062489831623d%7C0%7C0%7C637672794997533422%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=d35zEAfY3%2FZtoZZfA70QYD3PFd9jt%2FXoVE%2FtR7vg%3D&reserved=0> . We'll be conducting equally gh-quality events and engaging our members throughout the term.

IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve previously discussed with Joanne and weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll add ts under our Ã¢â‚¬Å“ResourcesÃ¢â‚¬Â section of the website, plus the Design cation landing page, where Ã¢â‚¬Å“DESTÃ¢â‚¬Â is featured. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll draft a summary/intro for the webpage so give me abit of time to do that. Will also amplify ts on our socials as well as our monthly D newsletter to our database, once the page is up. 

 

I tnk itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also be a good idea to share ts with the DEST network, i.e. past attendees, speakers, panellists, other stakeholders/partners. 

 

Thanks!

 INCIDENT OF ALTERCATION AT CANTEEN ON 16 SEP 2021 
 

 

 SUTD munity

 

 

On 16 September 2021, an argument between an employee at a canteen stall and one of our outsourced maintenance technicians led to a physical altercation. The stall employee suffered severe facial injuries in the process.  In turn, the stall employee chased the technician for a short disce before returning to the stall.  The incident was over in a matter of a few minutes. 

 

Upon being alerted, two of our security officers arrived on the scene promptly.  As part of our University Security Protocol, the security supervisor confirmed that there were no safety threats to other canteen users. T detained both parties involved wle waiting for the arrival of the police and the paramedics. After receiving treatment for their injuries, both men were arrested.

 

Regardless of the subsequent penal actions arising from the Police investigation, the University has informed the employers of both men that t are barred from working on campus with immediate effect. We will also take punitive action under the contract against the two contractor panies.

 

From our preliminary investigation and interviews, ts incident was a result of impulsive reactions to a situation rather than a premeditated intent to cause hurt. After both men had calmed down, t expressed regret for behaving recklessly.

 

For any security-related incidents or emergencies on campus, students and employees can call our 24/7 Security Hotline at Tel: 6303 6666 for assisce or the police at Tel: 999.

UROP Office

"
 INCIDENT OF ALTERCATION AT CANTEEN ON 16 SEP 2021," SUTDents, 

 

When the cabinet first came into our role, we assured students that we would ensure transparency between senior management and students. As such, when we saw that there were rumours spreading about the incident in canteen, we talked to management to address it so that it would help to ensure that safety of students are not promised. Hence, the statement was kindly released by Head of OCIF, Mr Foo Siang C.

 

We have noticed that he did not send the email out by bcc, wch is a mistake that we have made sometimes as well. That being said, a student has decided to reply all to the email with a meme. Given the sensitivity of the situation where people got hurt, it was inappropriate for the student to have replied in such a manner and also during a time when management are doing their best to handle the ongoing COVID-19 positive case in SUTD for our safety as well. 

 

Ts is not the first time someone has replied to all on an email where someone forgot to bcc. At first it might have been all fun and games but when it gets carried away too far, we bee aware of the consequences such as what has happened today. I agree that ts is an email etiquette that should be adopted by students but I also believe that there are better ways to bring the message across to the sender. As such, I implore you all to next time be professional and email directly to the sender. Not bcc-ing could have went unnoticed unless someone brings it to light at the end of the day. We hope that these unnecessary incidents will not happen again in our munity.

 

I have reached out to the student personally and since the email will also be shared with staff, I will accept full responsibility if management were to ask me about it as ultimately, I was the one who requested for the statement. Whether the student wants to apologise, I will leave it up to them to decide but I hope that ts will be a lesson to everyone and hope that we can move past ts incident all together as ONE SUTD and focus on more pertinent matters at hand. 

 

Thank you and have a good weekend ahead!

Tele-ROOT," SUTD Students!

 

Have you ever had any burning issues or feedback you would like to raise up? Or do you want to be kept updated of the current issues that have already been brought up? Well, regardless of wch one you want, ROOT has a solution for you. ROOT has rolled out its every own ROOT Telebot so you can raise up issues as and when you want. You can also use it to check the repository of feedback that has already been mentioned. 

 

Attached in ts email will be a brief manual on how to use the bot and the link to the Telebot itself! But do not worry too much, the bot is user-friendly and very intuitive, with instructions in every step! Now you may be wondering where does all ts feedback go? Is ts simply a venting platform for students? Well, t are valid questions but fret not! Each feedback sent through the bot will be routed to ROOT where we will collate, organize, and use ts collected feedback for the Dialogues with Senior Management. We hope ts initiative by ROOT will help increase the voices of students like you who would be able to make a better world in SUTD (by design)! 

 

You can access the bot via ts telehandle @SUTD_ROOT_bot or via ts link t.me/SUTD_ROOT_bot <apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook/?url=%3A%2F%2Ft.me%2FSUTD_ROOT_bot&data=04%7C01%7C_%40.sutd..%7C8947a8fd4f634f7c052b08d97ebdb40b%7C3476b776e9904f72b95062489831623d%7C0%7C0%7C637680176092606642%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=eshTicE%2F%2Bfn9ngPmQjOcjhpHbHFjJKw9Sk3rweFr4Ug%3D&reserved=0> .

2021 September Term - 10.022 : Modelling Uncertainty: Modelling Uncertainty Week 3," students,

Half an hour ago, I received a new update from the university: Modelling Uncertainty classes will continue to be conducted online in Week 3.

Unless you get an email from your cohort instructors sang otherwise, you can use the same Zoom links that you received last week to access the classes. These links will also be put on eDimension.

Some other announcements:

- Recordings of Week 2Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s classes are available on eDimension.

- Every week, there will be extra practice questions; answers to these questions will also be uploaded (though it may take me a wle to do ts).

- Homework 1 has been released on Cerebry; please use the class code SUTD-MU. The due date is end of Sunday, 3 October. To get full credit, you need to plete the 'strong' level for all 3 parts. Please note that Cerebry is still new technology, and as such suffers from various bugs, so I seek your undersding.

Best wishes,

James (course lead for Modelling Uncertainty)

"
Alumna to be," 

 

We will photo shop the presenter in 2023 for you. :)

We have 2 different design (as seen in the pdf page 2 & 3). For each design, we would like 320 copy. That would be a total quantity of 640 A6 stickers.

	We would prefer PayNow as the mode of payment. Do follow up on the payment procres. Also, do provide us an invoice such that we can claim from the school as well.

	Feel free to clarify any doubts with me. Thank you!

	Yours sincerely,

We cannot use the whole piece else PASS will e after us for loyalty payment.  I tnk the guideline is less than 20 sec (I need to check).

 

You may add in other music as well (ideally loyalty free music).  Once the photos are uploaded I will send the link to you.

 

Thanks and

We're not using the whole duration of the music, right? I can crop it to make it approximately 2-3min, depending on the clips. I should be able to sort the footage tonight and plete it by ts week.

I am tnking of piling a short video clip on the mencement Ceremonies for the Class of 2021.  We need to select video of the academic possession and those photos that pass the safe discing guidelines else we will t the headlines the moment we publish it in our social media platform form.  Need to go through all the photos of the 5 sessions and select only that meet the guideline (1m apart) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ I suspect there are not that many will make it.  Then insert the Pomp and Circumsce music - www.youtube/watch?v=Kw-_Ew5bVxs.

 

How long will it take you?

Sure, I can help with the video footage. Do you have a specific theme, mood, and purpose of the clip you're looking for? Any specific duration as well?

 

Just send me the drive link and I'll download all the materials to edit the video.

 

Yours sincerely,

Are you able to put together photos and video clip into video montage?  If you are able to help out it will be great!

We cannot use the whole piece else PASS will e after us for loyalty payment.  I tnk the guideline is less than 20 sec (I need to check).

 

You may add in other music as well (ideally loyalty free music).  Once the photos are uploaded I will send the link to you.

We're not using the whole duration of the music, right? I can crop it to make it approximately 2-3min, depending on the clips. I should be able to sort the footage tonight and plete it by ts week.

I am tnking of piling a short video clip on the mencement Ceremonies for the Class of 2021.  We need to select video of the academic possession and those photos that pass the safe discing guidelines else we will t the headlines the moment we publish it in our social media platform form.  Need to go through all the photos of the 5 sessions and select only that meet the guideline (1m apart) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ I suspect there are not that many will make it.  Then insert the Pomp and Circumsce music - www.youtube/watch?v=Kw-_Ew5bVxs.

 

How long will it take you?

 

Thanks and

Sure, I can help with the video footage. Do you have a specific theme, mood, and purpose of the clip you're looking for? Any specific duration as well?

 

Just send me the drive link and I'll download all the materials to edit the video.

 

Yours sincerely,

Thank you for helping out and your presence at our booth has helped liven up the mood for the Class of 2021.

 

Once we are able to organise in-person event we will have you in mind to engage you as student helper.

 

Are you able to put together photos and video clip into video montage?  If you are able to help out it will be great!

			Thanks for the quotation. Attached is our confirm order. I've attached an AI file as well, if it is more convenient for you. We would like kiss cut stickers on A6 sheet. We have 2 different design (as seen in the pdf page 2 & 3). For each design, we would like 320 copy. That would be a total quantity of 640 A6 stickers. 

			We would like it to be delivered to Singapore University of Technology and Design (8 Somapah Rd, Singapore 487372) anytime during a weekday. Do contact  (97705194) for collection and Darren (96331440) as a second contact person.

			We would prefer PayNow as the mode of payment. Do follow up on the payment procres. Also, do provide us an invoice such that we can claim from the school as well.

			Feel free to clarify any doubts with me. Thank you!

			Yours sincerely,

		Thanks for the quotation. Attached is our confirm order. I've attached an AI file as well, if it is more convenient for you. We would like kiss cut stickers on A6 sheet. We have 2 different design (as seen in the pdf page 2 & 3). For each design, we would like 320 copy. That would be a total quantity of 640 A6 stickers. 

		We would like it to be delivered to Singapore University of Technology and Design (8 Somapah Rd, Singapore 487372) anytime during a weekday. Do contact  (97705194) for collection and Darren (96331440) as a second contact person.

		We would prefer PayNow as the mode of payment. Do follow up on the payment procres. Also, do provide us an invoice such that we can claim from the school as well.

		Feel free to clarify any doubts with me. Thank you!

		Yours sincerely,

  Antigen Rapid Test (ART) Reimbursement Process

 

 Housing,

 

My residents applied for the ART kit online and many didn't receive it. For those who received, t received it very late in the day. As the deadline provided was 2pm (before extension was provided), some of them have already bought the kit and submit the results before receiving the kit from Housing. As such, the kit provided by Housing is still unused and t wish to reimburse the money instead. Could returning the kit to Housing be made possible?

 

Also, my resident from Blk 59 05-91 received a kit. However, as it is a double room, t're unsure who was the kit for. Could you help me check if it's Wei Xuan or Vanessa who got allocated the kit? Ts is to aid the reimbursement procre. 

 

Thank you! Hope to hear from you soon.

 

Yours sincerely,

Unfortunately we are unable to reimburse Jenna for the Kit that she bought as she submitted a request for the free ART through the link and gotten it from us.

She/Yourself may keep the kit issued to her as a form of reimbursement.

  Antigen Rapid Test (ART) Reimbursement Process

 

 Housing,

 

My residents applied for the ART kit online and many didn't receive it. For those who received, t received it very late in the day. As the deadline provided was 2pm (before extension was provided), some of them have already bought the kit and submit the results before receiving the kit from Housing. As such, the kit provided by Housing is still unused and t wish to reimburse the money instead. Could returning the kit to Housing be made possible?

 

Also, my resident from Blk 59 05-91 received a kit. However, as it is a double room, t're unsure who was the kit for. Could you help me check if it's Wei Xuan or Vanessa who got allocated the kit? Ts is to aid the reimbursement procre. 

 

Thank you! Hope to hear from you soon.

 

Yours sincerely,

We have 2 different design (as seen in the pdf page 2 & 3). For each design, we would like 320 copy. That would be a total quantity of 640 A6 stickers. 

				We would like it to be delivered to Singapore University of Technology and Design (8 Somapah Rd, Singapore 487372) anytime during a weekday. Do contact  (97705194) for collection and Darren (96331440) as a second contact person.

				We would prefer PayNow as the mode of payment. Do follow up on the payment procres. Also, do provide us an invoice such that we can claim from the school as well.

				Feel free to clarify any doubts with me. Thank you!

Here's the first cut of the video. Could you send me a png version of SUTD Alumni logo. I tried using an online one, but the version is very pixelated. 

 

I haven't adjusted the music entirely. Is the current music okay? I downloaded it from Envato and can request for a license for the music later on.

 

Do let me know if there is anytng to edit.

 

Yours sincerely,

We cannot use the whole piece else PASS will e after us for loyalty payment.  I tnk the guideline is less than 20 sec (I need to check).

I am tnking of piling a short video clip on the mencement Ceremonies for the Class of 2021.  We need to select video of the academic possession and those photos that pass the safe discing guidelines else we will t the headlines the moment we publish it in our social media platform form.  Need to go through all the photos of the 5 sessions and select only that meet the guideline (1m apart) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ I suspect there are not that many will make it.  Then insert the Pomp and Circumsce music - www.youtube/watch?v=Kw-_Ew5bVxs.

Thank you very much.  It looks good!

 

I couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t watch but able to listen to the music on my puter as it asked for HEVC Video Extensions.  The same happens to my Android phone but I can watch it on my IOS phone.

 

Attached is the SUTD logo with the word Alumni added on.  Ts is not the official one as Marketing only allows Pillars and certain offices to have their own logo.

"
2021 September Term - 10.020 : Data Driven World: DDW Lessons Arrangement when In-Campus Activity Starts," Students,

The University is going to announce that students can go back to campus soon. Since we do not know when ts announcement will arrive, DDW faculty decided to have a fixed schle of in-campus and online lessons regardless when the in-campus activity begins. Ts is to help you all to be prepared and not surprised by any sudden announcements from the University.

At the same time, we are aware that many of you may have concerns about ing back to campus due to the recent cases in COVID-19, and you may have older family members you wish to protect. We fully undersd your concerns and, therefore, decided to have the following measures to rce the risk of transmission.

*	When in-campus lessons kick-in, DDW lessons will have alternate weeks between in-campus and online lessons. The schle is as follows:
	Week 4: in-campus
	Week 5: online
	Week 6: in-campus
	Week 7: recess
	Week 8: in-campus
	Week 9: online
	Week 10: in-campus
	Week 11: online
	Week 12: in-campus
	Week 13: online

*	In the case when in-campus activity starts at Week 5, we will still follow the above schle. The above schle is also indicated in the Course HandoutÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Course Calendar <apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook/?url=%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google%2Fdocument%2Fd%2F1Gxt9sqX4mpC6pkR6PloBFYQujkAQS9obGJee2BM%2Fedit%23bookmark%3Did.75zab6t19dml&data=04%7C01%7C_%40.sutd..%7C679a7881132b49891acf08d983bb97a6%7C3476b776e9904f72b95062489831623d%7C0%7C0%7C637685664029672000%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=2d9hV7cch1r4okt3fczkKIhQRc%2BMqDCNMeQt3aeD0%3D&reserved=0> .

*	The purpose of alternating weeks is to rce the risk. A few of our faculty teaches more than three classes and that amounts to meeting more than 200 students. Alternating the weeks rces the risk that any faculty may bee the source of spread among the students. In the week of in-campus lessons, there will only be one lead instructor in the class and the supporting Faculty will continue to support you online through MS Teams. You are allowed to initiate a video call during the lessons with the supporting faculty or TA in class. Please use your earphones so as not to disrupt the physical class. The reason for ts separation is to ensure that the class can continue if the lead instructor is down due to a positive case or quarantine. 

*	The trd sessions (Lessons 3) in the week are usually dedicated to doing Mini Projects in Weeks 4 to 6. Since the measures only allow two-person group works, we will move all trd sessions in Weeks 4 to 6 to online lessons regardless of the weeks. Ts allows groups of three persons to continue to work together and get checkoffs from instructors using MS Teams.

*	You are not required to physically attend DDW lessons and we will live-stream all lessons using MS Teams and record it at the respective channels for each Cohorts. Please remind the lead instructor to record it or you can initiate the recording yourself. We undersd that other subjects may still require you to attend the class physically and it is the decision of each subject leads wch we have no control over. 

*	It is import that both faculty and students put their best efforts to rce the risk by keeping personal hygiene and rcing close-contact interactions during the physical lessons. Though Faculty will try their best to minimize interaction, it is natural that Faculty tend to help students during the lessons and you may municate to the faculty if there are any actions that make you unfortable. We will remind one another to ensure that masks are worn at all times and those who are not well should remain at home. Ts applies to Faculty as well as students.

We make ts decision for the best of all and we seek your undersding during ts time. We mit our best efforts to deliver the best possible learning experience for you. Thank you. 

On behalf of the DDW Teacng Team

"
Notes written during class for 30th September," all,

Some of you asked for the notes written during class just now, so here t are. 

Cheers,
Jia 

--------- Below is inconsequential to your grades/exam and can be ignored but it can be fun too ---------------
--------- Spoiler alert for 'Squid Game' -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've seen some of you who are quite fast in class, so to challenge you, I randomly came up with questions. The question is inspired by the Netflix series 'Squid Game'. In Game 5, the contests are supposed to walk through a glass bridge with 18 steps (or was it some other number?). For each step, there are 2 choices, one is tempered glass that cannot withsd the weight of a single person, wle the other is glass that can withsd the weight of 2 people. There's no way to tell the two types of glasses apart and you are eliminated (i.e. die) if you step on the wrong glass. So, we know that the probability for contest 1 (who walks the bridge first) to cross the bridge is 1/2^18 because he/she must guess the correct pieces for 18 steps. We also know that the 19th contest can definitely cross safely, because even if everyone else before m/her is unlucky and guess the wrong one, by the 19th person, all the tempered glass would have shattered. What's the probability that the mth contest (where m <= 18) can cross safely? I have no idea what the answer is, I was just tnking of ts wle watcng the series, so if you know a solution, please tell me. If you don't undersd the question, then go watch 'Squid Game', and if your parents ask you why you are not studng, you can just say you are studng probability now (but please undersd the course material too and try to apply them wle watcng the series). 

Actually, we can set some probability question around Game 2 as well (the one with the dalgona candy). Say the probability of contests choosing Star, Circle, Triangle, and Umbrella are all equal. Probability of success for star, circle, triangle, and umbrella are 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.3 respectively. What's the probability of success? In ts case, you will be using the law of total probability. P(success) = P(success|star)P(star) + P(success|circle)P(circle) + P(success|triangle)P(triangle) + P(success|umbrella)P(umbrella). 


 Ts is just to demonstrate that the current course you are taking is very applicable to real life. We can always spot some examples of its application!

Cohort Exco List," all,

 

Just a gentle reminder to meet up with your cohort (if you havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t) and form the exco member for the class by 8 Oct (at least for the Chair and Deputy Chair). Ts is because the management would like to invite them for a  dialogue session sometime next week, so would appreciate if we could have the Chair and Deputy Chair formed. Undersd the students required more time to recruit the members as students havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t got much chance to know their peers well given classes remained online for the past 3 weeks. You can suggest the class to send 1 or 2 representative for now and elect one when t feel fortable. 

 

For the rest of the excos, you may submit the list by 15 Oct. Library, OSA, Fab Lab, AV will also be conducting briefing for the use of equipment, library books, first aid training and munication on exams process specifically for the AV, Library, Fab Lab and first aid reps, Chair and Deputy for their respective roles. We also need to grant access to the stationery reps to access the vending macnes.

 

Please try to arrange a meet up with the class via online ts week. 

 

Thank you

Ã¢â‚¬Å“A monolitcally integrated polymer microtoroid-waveguide system and nested double spiral waveguides are proposed and fabricated, wch solves the coupling problem of microtoroid resonator and increase data capacity by utilising Space Division Multiplexing. The waveguides are also demonstrated to support 30 Gb/s NRZ and 28 Gb/s PAM 4 gh-speed data.Ã¢â‚¬Â

 

 

 

Ã¢â‚¬Å“Shaping the Futures of Work is a timely sociological exploration of the impact of technological innovations on employment. Nilanjan Raghunath proposes that stakeholders such as states, enterprises, and citizens hold equally import roles in ensuring that people can adapt, innovate, and thrive witn conditions of flux.Ã¢â‚¬Â

 

 

 

Ã¢â‚¬Å“Design is a plex iterative process, however existing file management for parametric design doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t support it. To solve ts we developed Ã¢â‚¬Å“GHShotÃ¢â‚¬Â an Github like system for versioning visual programming.

  Antigen Rapid Test (ART) Reimbursement Process

 

 Housing,

 

My residents applied for the ART kit online and many didn't receive it. For those who received, t received it very late in the day. As the deadline provided was 2pm (before extension was provided), some of them have already bought the kit and submit the results before receiving the kit from Housing. As such, the kit provided by Housing is still unused and t wish to reimburse the money instead. Could returning the kit to Housing be made possible?

 

Also, my resident from Blk 59 05-91 received a kit. However, as it is a double room, t're unsure who was the kit for. Could you help me check if it's Wei Xuan or Vanessa who got allocated the kit? Ts is to aid the reimbursement procre. 

 

Thank you! Hope to hear from you soon.

 

Yours sincerely,

 Antigen Rapid Test (ART) Reimbursement Process 
 

  , ,

 

Around 16-17 September 2021, you were informed to do an Antigen Rapid Test (ART).  

 

If you would like to be reimbursed for the above because you had to purchase a test kit or had done it at a clinic, kindly refer to the steps below. 

 

To be eligible for reimbursement, you must not have been provided with an ART kit by the University.  

 

Please submit your original hardcopy receipts as follows:

 

*	When: 28th September to 6th October 2021
*	Whe Drop-box located at the Security Counter at Block 59 level 1
*	Import: write your full name and SUTD ID on the front of the receipt. Details of purchase (e.g. date and amount) on the receipts must be clearly visible.  Take a photo of the receipt for your reference before dropping it off. Kindly note that only original hardcopy receipts are acceptable for reimbursement processing.
*	Accepted for reimbursement: receipts dated between 16th and 17th  September 2021 (i.e. from when you received the email till submission of your test results)
*	Restriction: Limited to 1 claim per hostel resident.

 

If you had bought ART kits on behalf of your hostel mates:

 

*	Drop us an email and include their SUTD email addresses in the CC list. 
*	Your hostel mates will need to reply to that email to acknowledge that the purchase was made on their behalf. Otherwise, the reimbursement will not be processed. 
*	Your hostel mates must not be making any other claim for the ART costs or had not been given an ART kit by the University

 

The amount will be reimbursed to the credit bank account maintained in MyPortal. Kindly update your credit bank account details in MyPortal by 6 October 2021 if you have not done so. 

 

Due to the large volume of claims, it may take up to 6-10 weeks from the submission deadline for you to receive your reimbursement.

 

If we have received your receipts, an email acknowledgement will be sent to you by 13 October 2021. If you did not receive our email by ts date, do email us to check on your status.

			 Natalie,

			 

			Here's the attachments. Really sorry I am unable to draw the cut line but it should be pretty obvious from the design, just outside the rounded edges will do. 

			 

			The following information is from my previous email:

				I have 5 designs I wish to print, as attached in the email. Below is the dimension (width * height) of each design:

				Design 1: 93mm * 44mm

				Design 2: 62mm * 50mm

				Design 3: 85mm * 44mm

				Design 4: 87mm * 41mm

				Design 5: 100mm * 37mm

				 

				For each design IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m looking at a quantity of about 100 each, with a budget of sometng near $200. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve tried plang with the dimensions on your online platform and it derives at 4/5 sheet each time. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m flexible with the quantity of each design, it may defer according to the quantity on each sheet and price.

				 

				Details: Waterproof Sticker, Die Cut for all, PET (Gloss Wte), 2mm border and round edge according to the image.

				 

				I would like to self-collect it next Monday afternoon, 11 October.

			Thank you! Feel free to clarify any queries.

			 

			Yours sincerely, 

			 Ã¢â‚¬â€¹

Extension of Antigen Rapid Test (ART) reimbursement exercise,"  , ,

 

Around 16 - 17 September 2021, you were informed to do an Antigen Rapid Test (ART). 

 

Ts email serves as a notice to inform you that the window for the submission of your claim has been extended to 13th October 2021. 

If you have not submitted your claim, please do so by the specified date.

 

After the 13th of October 2021, we will no longer accept any submissions.

 

If you would like to be reimbursed for the above because you had to purchase a test kit or had done it at a clinic, kindly refer to the steps below. 

 

To be eligible for reimbursement, you must not have been provided with an ART kit by the University.  

 

Please submit your original hardcopy receipts as follows:

 

*	When: By the of 13th October 2021
*	Whe Drop-box located at the Security Counter at Block 59 level 1
*	Accepted for reimbursement: Receipts dated between 16th and 17th September 2021 (From when you received the email till submission of your test results)
*	Restriction: Limited to 1 claim per hostel resident.
*	Import: Write your full name and SUTD ID on the front of the receipt. Details of purchase (Date and amount) on the receipts must be clearly visible.  Take a photo of the receipt for your reference before dropping it off. Do note that only original hardcopy receipts are acceptable for reimbursement processing.

 

If you bought ART kits on behalf of your hostel mates:

 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢             Drop us an email and include their SUTD email addresses in the CC list. 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢             Your hostel mates will need to reply to that email to acknowledge that the purchase was made on their behalf. Otherwise, the reimbursement will not be processed. 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢             Your hostel mates must not be making any other claim for the ART costs or had not been given an ART kit by the University

 

The amount will be reimbursed to the credit bank account maintained in MyPortal. 

 

Kindly update your credit bank account details in MyPortal by 13th October 2021 if you have not done so. 

 

Due to the large volume of claims, it may take up to 6-10 weeks from the submission deadline (13th October) for you to receive your reimbursement.

 

If we have received your receipts, an email acknowledgement will be sent to you by 13 October 2021. If you did not receive our email by ts date, do email us to check on your status.

	 Natalie,

	Can I reconfirm that the stickers will be all individual? Cause from my undersding of kisscut is that it will be placed in a sheet. However, I'm looking for die cut where the stickers will be all separated from the sheet. 

	Thank you!

	Yours sincerely,

				 Natalie,

				Can I reconfirm that the stickers will be all individual? Cause from my undersding of kisscut is that it will be placed in a sheet. However, I'm looking for die cut where the stickers will be all separated from the sheet. 

				Thank you!

"
 Term 1 Class Fund Claim Procedure," ,

 

The students can spend the class fund of $250 for ts term even if t have not selected the treasurer yet. But t have to seek the approval from  the faculty / staff cohort advisor. We can only conduct the frist exco meeting when all the cohorts excos are elected. Most of the  cohort advisors are experience and t have also been cohort advisors for last few years. Thus t would be able to  advise the class on the claims process  eg filling in the budget utilisation form and submitting the claims through the Concur system together with the receipts. We will conduct the briefing for the claims process during the first excos meeting. Meanwle students may consult their cohort advisors for advise on the claims  process before the first excos dialogue sesson. For info the concur system is under Finance and if students required a detailed breifng on the system, we will need to seek FiannceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s help to conduct the briefing.

 

In all cases, please consult the faculty cohort advisors first. Most of them except for the new cohort advisors are very experienced and t would be able to advise the students  base on a case by case basis.

 

Let me know if you still encounter any problems.

 

Thanks

 Term 1 Class Fund Claim Procre

 

 Bee Fong,

 

The cohort advisors are interacting with the classes and noticed a problem happening with the class fund. As such, we would like to seek your clarification. 

 

Firstly, some Term 1 class are actually wanting to spend the money on welfare packs or class t-srt/jacket. However, t are unsure of the claim procre. I undersd that it could be due to some classes that hasn't settled the class mittee. If the concur briefing will not be conducted anytime soon, is it possible to clarify the procre on how classes can use the fund and claim it first? It'll be nice if you can share with us the concur slides so we can send to the treasurer to familiarise too.  

 

Secondly, for classes who hasn't select a class m, there could be a delay in their use of class fund as well. Can I check if there's a way for classes who hasn't select a class mittee to spend the class fund first? In another words, could you provide us the finance/claim procre on how to use class fund for classes who has a class m and for those who don't have one respectively? 

 

Lastly, when will the first cohort meeting for the class exco mittee and the concur briefing for the treasurer be? We're tnking that it'll be good to allow classes to settle down quickly since t only have 2 terms together (wch means almost 1/4 is over).

 

Thank you for the hard work arranging all the class matters in midst of ts pandemic! We really appreciate it Ã¢ÂÂ¤Ã¯Â¸Â

 

Have a great day ahead!

 

Yours sincerely,

  Antigen Rapid Test (ART) Reimbursement Process

 

!

 

Checking with them now. Can I check is it only those 5 are unable to reimburse? What about the others in the list? Can you provide me a full list to check and settle ts with my resident. The whole reimbursement process has been really confusing for my resident. The rest who were provided the kit will wish to return it as well. 

 

Thank you.

 

Yours sincerely,

  Antigen Rapid Test (ART) Reimbursement Process

 

 Housing,

 

My residents applied for the ART kit online and many didn't receive it. For those who received, t received it very late in the day. As the deadline provided was 2pm (before extension was provided), some of them have already bought the kit and submit the results before receiving the kit from Housing. As such, the kit provided by Housing is still unused and t wish to reimburse the money instead. Could returning the kit to Housing be made possible?

 

Also, my resident from Blk 59 05-91 received a kit. However, as it is a double room, t're unsure who was the kit for. Could you help me check if it's Wei Xuan or Vanessa who got allocated the kit? Ts is to aid the reimbursement procre. 

 

Thank you! Hope to hear from you soon.

 

Yours sincerely,

 Antigen Rapid Test (ART) Reimbursement Process 

 

  , ,

 

Around 16-17 September 2021, you were informed to do an Antigen Rapid Test (ART).  

 

If you would like to be reimbursed for the above because you had to purchase a test kit or had done it at a clinic, kindly refer to the steps below. 

 

To be eligible for reimbursement, you must not have been provided with an ART kit by the University.  

 

Please submit your original hardcopy receipts as follows:

 

*         When: 28th September to 6th October 2021

*         Whe Drop-box located at the Security Counter at Block 59 level 1

*         Import: write your full name and SUTD ID on the front of the receipt. Details of purchase (e.g. date and amount) on the receipts must be clearly visible.  Take a photo of the receipt for your reference before dropping it off. Kindly note that only original hardcopy receipts are acceptable for reimbursement processing.

*         Accepted for reimbursement: receipts dated between 16th and 17th  September 2021 (i.e. from when you received the email till submission of your test results)

*         Restriction: Limited to 1 claim per hostel resident.

 

If you had bought ART kits on behalf of your hostel mates:

 

*         Drop us an email and include their SUTD email addresses in the CC list. 

*         Your hostel mates will need to reply to that email to acknowledge that the purchase was made on their behalf. Otherwise, the reimbursement will not be processed. 

*         Your hostel mates must not be making any other claim for the ART costs or had not been given an ART kit by the University

 

The amount will be reimbursed to the credit bank account maintained in MyPortal. Kindly update your credit bank account details in MyPortal by 6 October 2021 if you have not done so. 

 

Due to the large volume of claims, it may take up to 6-10 weeks from the submission deadline for you to receive your reimbursement.

 

If we have received your receipts, an email acknowledgement will be sent to you by 13 October 2021. If you did not receive our email by ts date, do email us to check on your status.

  Antigen Rapid Test (ART) Reimbursement Process

 

 Housing,

 

My residents applied for the ART kit online and many didn't receive it. For those who received, t received it very late in the day. As the deadline provided was 2pm (before extension was provided), some of them have already bought the kit and submit the results before receiving the kit from Housing. As such, the kit provided by Housing is still unused and t wish to reimburse the money instead. Could returning the kit to Housing be made possible?

 

Also, my resident from Blk 59 05-91 received a kit. However, as it is a double room, t're unsure who was the kit for. Could you help me check if it's Wei Xuan or Vanessa who got allocated the kit? Ts is to aid the reimbursement procre. 

 

Thank you! Hope to hear from you soon.

 

Yours sincerely,

 Antigen Rapid Test (ART) Reimbursement Process 

 

  , ,

 

Around 16-17 September 2021, you were informed to do an Antigen Rapid Test (ART).  

 

If you would like to be reimbursed for the above because you had to purchase a test kit or had done it at a clinic, kindly refer to the steps below. 

 

To be eligible for reimbursement, you must not have been provided with an ART kit by the University.  

 

Please submit your original hardcopy receipts as follows:

 

*         When: 28th September to 6th October 2021

*         Whe Drop-box located at the Security Counter at Block 59 level 1

*         Import: write your full name and SUTD ID on the front of the receipt. Details of purchase (e.g. date and amount) on the receipts must be clearly visible.  Take a photo of the receipt for your reference before dropping it off. Kindly note that only original hardcopy receipts are acceptable for reimbursement processing.

*         Accepted for reimbursement: receipts dated between 16th and 17th  September 2021 (i.e. from when you received the email till submission of your test results)

*         Restriction: Limited to 1 claim per hostel resident.

 

If you had bought ART kits on behalf of your hostel mates:

 

*         Drop us an email and include their SUTD email addresses in the CC list. 

*         Your hostel mates will need to reply to that email to acknowledge that the purchase was made on their behalf. Otherwise, the reimbursement will not be processed. 

*         Your hostel mates must not be making any other claim for the ART costs or had not been given an ART kit by the University

 

The amount will be reimbursed to the credit bank account maintained in MyPortal. Kindly update your credit bank account details in MyPortal by 6 October 2021 if you have not done so. 

 

Due to the large volume of claims, it may take up to 6-10 weeks from the submission deadline for you to receive your reimbursement.

 

If we have received your receipts, an email acknowledgement will be sent to you by 13 October 2021. If you did not receive our email by ts date, do email us to check on your status.

 

Should you have any queries, please contact us at 6434 8225 or email ecchousing@sutd.. <mailecchousing@sutd..> . 

 

Thank you.

  Antigen Rapid Test (ART) Reimbursement Process

 

!

 

Checking with them now. Can I check is it only those 5 are unable to reimburse? What about the others in the list? Can you provide me a full list to check and settle ts with my resident. The whole reimbursement process has been really confusing for my resident. The rest who were provided the kit will wish to return it as well. 

 

Thank you.

 

Yours sincerely,

  Antigen Rapid Test (ART) Reimbursement Process

 

 Housing,

 

My residents applied for the ART kit online and many didn't receive it. For those who received, t received it very late in the day. As the deadline provided was 2pm (before extension was provided), some of them have already bought the kit and submit the results before receiving the kit from Housing. As such, the kit provided by Housing is still unused and t wish to reimburse the money instead. Could returning the kit to Housing be made possible?

 

Also, my resident from Blk 59 05-91 received a kit. However, as it is a double room, t're unsure who was the kit for. Could you help me check if it's Wei Xuan or Vanessa who got allocated the kit? Ts is to aid the reimbursement procre. 

 

Thank you! Hope to hear from you soon.

 

Yours sincerely,

 Antigen Rapid Test (ART) Reimbursement Process 

 

  , ,

 

Around 16-17 September 2021, you were informed to do an Antigen Rapid Test (ART).  

 

If you would like to be reimbursed for the above because you had to purchase a test kit or had done it at a clinic, kindly refer to the steps below. 

 

To be eligible for reimbursement, you must not have been provided with an ART kit by the University.  

 

Please submit your original hardcopy receipts as follows:

 

*         When: 28th September to 6th October 2021

*         Whe Drop-box located at the Security Counter at Block 59 level 1

*         Import: write your full name and SUTD ID on the front of the receipt. Details of purchase (e.g. date and amount) on the receipts must be clearly visible.  Take a photo of the receipt for your reference before dropping it off. Kindly note that only original hardcopy receipts are acceptable for reimbursement processing.

*         Accepted for reimbursement: receipts dated between 16th and 17th  September 2021 (i.e. from when you received the email till submission of your test results)

*         Restriction: Limited to 1 claim per hostel resident.

 

If you had bought ART kits on behalf of your hostel mates:

 

*         Drop us an email and include their SUTD email addresses in the CC list. 

*         Your hostel mates will need to reply to that email to acknowledge that the purchase was made on their behalf. Otherwise, the reimbursement will not be processed. 

*         Your hostel mates must not be making any other claim for the ART costs or had not been given an ART kit by the University

 

The amount will be reimbursed to the credit bank account maintained in MyPortal. Kindly update your credit bank account details in MyPortal by 6 October 2021 if you have not done so. 

 

Due to the large volume of claims, it may take up to 6-10 weeks from the submission deadline for you to receive your reimbursement.

 

If we have received your receipts, an email acknowledgement will be sent to you by 13 October 2021. If you did not receive our email by ts date, do email us to check on your status.

  Term 1 Class Fund Claim Procre

 

 ,

 

The students can spend the class fund of $250 for ts term even if t have not selected the treasurer yet. But t have to seek the approval from  the faculty / staff cohort advisor. We can only conduct the first exco meeting when all the cohorts excos are elected. Most of the  cohort advisors are experience and t have also been cohort advisors for last few years. Thus t would be able to  advise the class on the claims process  eg filling in the budget utilisation form and submitting the claims through the Concur system together with the receipts. We will conduct the briefing for the claims process during the first excos meeting. Meanwle students may consult their cohort advisors for advise on the claims  process before the first excos dialogue session. For info the concur system is under Finance and if students required a detailed briefing on the system, we will need to seek FinanceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s help to conduct the briefing.

 

In all cases, please consult the faculty cohort advisors first. Most of them except for the new cohort advisors are very experienced and t would be able to advise the students  base on a case by case basis.

 

Let me know if you still encounter any problems.

 

Thanks

 Term 1 Class Fund Claim Procre

 

 Bee Fong,

 

The cohort advisors are interacting with the classes and noticed a problem happening with the class fund. As such, we would like to seek your clarification. 

 

Firstly, some Term 1 class are actually wanting to spend the money on welfare packs or class t-srt/jacket. However, t are unsure of the claim procre. I undersd that it could be due to some classes that hasn't settled the class mittee. If the concur briefing will not be conducted anytime soon, is it possible to clarify the procre on how classes can use the fund and claim it first? It'll be nice if you can share with us the concur slides so we can send to the treasurer to familiarise too.  

 

Secondly, for classes who hasn't select a class m, there could be a delay in their use of class fund as well. Can I check if there's a way for classes who hasn't select a class mittee to spend the class fund first? In another words, could you provide us the finance/claim procre on how to use class fund for classes who has a class m and for those who don't have one respectively? 

 

Lastly, when will the first cohort meeting for the class exco mittee and the concur briefing for the treasurer be? We're tnking that it'll be good to allow classes to settle down quickly since t only have 2 terms together (wch means almost 1/4 is over).

 

Thank you for the hard work arranging all the class matters in midst of ts pandemic! We really appreciate it Ã¢ÂÂ¤Ã¯Â¸Â

 

Have a great day ahead!

  Term 1 Class Fund Claim Procre

 

 ,

 

The students can spend the class fund of $250 for ts term even if t have not selected the treasurer yet. But t have to seek the approval from  the faculty / staff cohort advisor. We can only conduct the frist exco meeting when all the cohorts excos are elected. Most of the  cohort advisors are experience and t have also been cohort advisors for last few years. Thus t would be able to  advise the class on the claims process  eg filling in the budget utilisation form and submitting the claims through the Concur system together with the receipts. We will conduct the briefing for the claims process during the first excos meeting. Meanwle students may consult their cohort advisors for advise on the claims  process before the first excos dialogue sesson. For info the concur system is under Finance and if students required a detailed breifng on the system, we will need to seek FiannceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s help to conduct the briefing.

 

In all cases, please consult the faculty cohort advisors first. Most of them except for the new cohort advisors are very experienced and t would be able to advise the students  base on a case by case basis.

 

Let me know if you still encounter any problems.

 

Thanks

 Term 1 Class Fund Claim Procre

 

 Bee Fong,

 

The cohort advisors are interacting with the classes and noticed a problem happening with the class fund. As such, we would like to seek your clarification. 

 

Firstly, some Term 1 class are actually wanting to spend the money on welfare packs or class t-srt/jacket. However, t are unsure of the claim procre. I undersd that it could be due to some classes that hasn't settled the class mittee. If the concur briefing will not be conducted anytime soon, is it possible to clarify the procre on how classes can use the fund and claim it first? It'll be nice if you can share with us the concur slides so we can send to the treasurer to familiarise too.  

 

Secondly, for classes who hasn't select a class m, there could be a delay in their use of class fund as well. Can I check if there's a way for classes who hasn't select a class mittee to spend the class fund first? In another words, could you provide us the finance/claim procre on how to use class fund for classes who has a class m and for those who don't have one respectively? 

 

Lastly, when will the first cohort meeting for the class exco mittee and the concur briefing for the treasurer be? We're tnking that it'll be good to allow classes to settle down quickly since t only have 2 terms together (wch means almost 1/4 is over).

 

Thank you for the hard work arranging all the class matters in midst of ts pandemic! We really appreciate it Ã¢ÂÂ¤Ã¯Â¸Â

 

Have a great day ahead!

 

Yours sincerely,

Around 16-17 September 2021, you were informed to do an Antigen Rapid Test (ART).

*         Import: write your full name and SUTD ID on the front of the receipt. Details of purchase (e.g. date and amount) on the receipts must be clearly visible.  Take a photo of the receipt for your reference before dropping it off. Kindly note that only original hardcopy receipts are acceptable for reimbursement processing.

*         Accepted for reimbursement: receipts dated between 16th and 17th  September 2021 (i.e. from when you received the email till submission of your test results)

If you had bought ART kits on behalf of your hostel mates:

 

*         Drop us an email and include their SUTD email addresses in the CC list.

  Term 1 Class Fund Claim Procre 
 

 ,

 

Below is a summary of the fund claims process as a refresher. Ts information was previously  shared with your batch of cohort student excos (Chair, Deputy Chair and Treasurer) and cohort advisors during one of the excos and cohort advisors  dialogue session in  Term 1, AY2020. Hope ts helps. Thanks.

 

Student Claims

-          Students to submit email approval from cohort advisor, scanned copy of receipt and fund utilisation form in concur.

-          Students to obtain approval from cohort advisor before proceeding with purchase. Class funds cannot be used for repair/ replacement of items in cohort classroom, fort items such as sleeping bed, couch, cuson and decorations items. Class fund is only used for team bonding activity. Please check with your cohort advisor if you are unsure of the items wch are claimable before proceeding with the purchase to avoid your claims being rejected.

-          Students to key in correct information reflected on the receipts in concur to avoid delay in processing of claims. Incorrect information reflected in the claims will be returned to students.  

-          Please indicate the GL Project as 00OSXP in your class fund claims submission in Concur. The Budget Center, Cost Center and GL Account are as per below:

  Term 1 Class Fund Claim Procre

 

 ,

 

The students can spend the class fund of $250 for ts term even if t have not selected the treasurer yet. But t have to seek the approval from  the faculty / staff cohort advisor. We can only conduct the first exco meeting when all the cohorts excos are elected. Most of the  cohort advisors are experience and t have also been cohort advisors for last few years. Thus t would be able to  advise the class on the claims process  eg filling in the budget utilisation form and submitting the claims through the Concur system together with the receipts. We will conduct the briefing for the claims process during the first excos meeting. Meanwle students may consult their cohort advisors for advise on the claims  process before the first excos dialogue session. For info the concur system is under Finance and if students required a detailed briefing on the system, we will need to seek FinanceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s help to conduct the briefing.

 

In all cases, please consult the faculty cohort advisors first. Most of them except for the new cohort advisors are very experienced and t would be able to advise the students  base on a case by case basis.

 

Let me know if you still encounter any problems.

 

Thanks

 Term 1 Class Fund Claim Procre

 

 Bee Fong,

 

The cohort advisors are interacting with the classes and noticed a problem happening with the class fund. As such, we would like to seek your clarification. 

 

Firstly, some Term 1 class are actually wanting to spend the money on welfare packs or class t-srt/jacket. However, t are unsure of the claim procre. I undersd that it could be due to some classes that hasn't settled the class mittee. If the concur briefing will not be conducted anytime soon, is it possible to clarify the procre on how classes can use the fund and claim it first? It'll be nice if you can share with us the concur slides so we can send to the treasurer to familiarise too.  

 

Secondly, for classes who hasn't select a class m, there could be a delay in their use of class fund as well. Can I check if there's a way for classes who hasn't select a class mittee to spend the class fund first? In another words, could you provide us the finance/claim procre on how to use class fund for classes who has a class m and for those who don't have one respectively? 

 

Lastly, when will the first cohort meeting for the class exco mittee and the concur briefing for the treasurer be? We're tnking that it'll be good to allow classes to settle down quickly since t only have 2 terms together (wch means almost 1/4 is over).

 

Thank you for the hard work arranging all the class matters in midst of ts pandemic! We really appreciate it Ã¢ÂÂ¤Ã¯Â¸Â

 

Have a great day ahead!

 

Yours sincerely,

 Term 1 Class Fund Claim Procedure," Issac, 

You must have mixed up the class fund with other award prizes. The class fund has always been $250 for term 1 and another $250 for term 2 since we started the  program. $ 300 is for the winner of Cleanest classroom award.  Please check with the staff or faculty cohort that you are paired with if in doubts.

Thanks

  Term 1 Class Fund Claim Procre

 

 ,

 

The students can spend the class fund of $250 for ts term even if t have not selected the treasurer yet. But t have to seek the approval from  the faculty / staff cohort advisor. We can only conduct the first exco meeting when all the cohorts excos are elected. Most of the  cohort advisors are experience and t have also been cohort advisors for last few years. Thus t would be able to  advise the class on the claims process  eg filling in the budget utilisation form and submitting the claims through the Concur system together with the receipts. We will conduct the briefing for the claims process during the first excos meeting. Meanwle students may consult their cohort advisors for advise on the claims  process before the first excos dialogue session. For info the concur system is under Finance and if students required a detailed briefing on the system, we will need to seek FinanceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s help to conduct the briefing.

 

In all cases, please consult the faculty cohort advisors first. Most of them except for the new cohort advisors are very experienced and t would be able to advise the students  base on a case by case basis.

 

Let me know if you still encounter any problems.

 

Thanks

 Term 1 Class Fund Claim Procre

 

 Bee Fong,

 

The cohort advisors are interacting with the classes and noticed a problem happening with the class fund. As such, we would like to seek your clarification. 

 

Firstly, some Term 1 class are actually wanting to spend the money on welfare packs or class t-srt/jacket. However, t are unsure of the claim procre. I undersd that it could be due to some classes that hasn't settled the class mittee. If the concur briefing will not be conducted anytime soon, is it possible to clarify the procre on how classes can use the fund and claim it first? It'll be nice if you can share with us the concur slides so we can send to the treasurer to familiarise too.  

 

Secondly, for classes who hasn't select a class m, there could be a delay in their use of class fund as well. Can I check if there's a way for classes who hasn't select a class mittee to spend the class fund first? In another words, could you provide us the finance/claim procre on how to use class fund for classes who has a class m and for those who don't have one respectively? 

 

Lastly, when will the first cohort meeting for the class exco mittee and the concur briefing for the treasurer be? We're tnking that it'll be good to allow classes to settle down quickly since t only have 2 terms together (wch means almost 1/4 is over).

 

Thank you for the hard work arranging all the class matters in midst of ts pandemic! We really appreciate it Ã¢ÂÂ¤Ã¯Â¸Â

 

Have a great day ahead!

The students can spend the class fund of $250 for ts term even if t have not selected the treasurer yet. But t have to seek the approval from  the faculty / staff cohort advisor. We can only conduct the first exco meeting when all the cohorts excos are elected. Most of the  cohort advisors are experience and t have also been cohort advisors for last few years. Thus t would be able to  advise the class on the claims process  eg filling in the budget utilisation form and submitting the claims through the Concur system together with the receipts. We will conduct the briefing for the claims process during the first excos meeting. Meanwle students may consult their cohort advisors for advise on the claims  process before the first excos dialogue session. For info the concur system is under Finance and if students required a detailed briefing on the system, we will need to seek FinanceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s help to conduct the briefing.

 

In all cases, please consult the faculty cohort advisors first. Most of them except for the new cohort advisors are very experienced and t would be able to advise the students  base on a case by case basis.

 

Let me know if you still encounter any problems.

 

Thanks

 Term 1 Class Fund Claim Procre

 

 Bee Fong,

 

The cohort advisors are interacting with the classes and noticed a problem happening with the class fund. As such, we would like to seek your clarification. 

 

Firstly, some Term 1 class are actually wanting to spend the money on welfare packs or class t-srt/jacket. However, t are unsure of the claim procre. I undersd that it could be due to some classes that hasn't settled the class mittee. If the concur briefing will not be conducted anytime soon, is it possible to clarify the procre on how classes can use the fund and claim it first? It'll be nice if you can share with us the concur slides so we can send to the treasurer to familiarise too.  

 

Secondly, for classes who hasn't select a class m, there could be a delay in their use of class fund as well. Can I check if there's a way for classes who hasn't select a class mittee to spend the class fund first? In another words, could you provide us the finance/claim procre on how to use class fund for classes who has a class m and for those who don't have one respectively? 

 

Lastly, when will the first cohort meeting for the class exco mittee and the concur briefing for the treasurer be? We're tnking that it'll be good to allow classes to settle down quickly since t only have 2 terms together (wch means almost 1/4 is over).

 

Thank you for the hard work arranging all the class matters in midst of ts pandemic! We really appreciate it Ã¢ÂÂ¤Ã¯Â¸Â

 

Have a great day ahead!

 

Yours sincerely,

 Request for extension of cohort classroom access

 

To whom it may concern,

 

IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m  , a term 3 student. I'm writing in  to the opening hours of the cohort classrooms.

First of all, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the offices for making physical classes possible during ts tough period. 

 

As projects, like 1D and 2D, are kicking in, I've received feedback from my fellow batchmates that t would like an extension of classroom access till 10pm for subsequent weeks (Week 6 to 14). An example would be for 10.023 Designing Energy Systems students, groups are building physical prototypes, like a peltier fridge and a solar powered device. Such prototyping heavy projects are difficult to do without meeting physically. Furthermore, as many Term 3 students do not stay in hostel, t can't access the group study room and school campus is the only alternative for them. Thus, we would like to seek your kind assisce to extend the hours. 

 

If we're given the extension, we would ensure safe management measures (SMM) will be strictly abided, such as submitting our ART results for weekly campus access and remaining in our groups of 2 for Week 6 and groups of 5 for subsequent weeks. In addition, we undersd OCIF's potential consideration of the electricity wastage. Thus, we are agreeable on working on just turning on the classroom fans, as long as access is granted.

 

Lastly, I thought that it would be nice if ts extension could be provided for the Term 1 students as well, since t are starting on projects. 

 

Thus, we would like to seek the approval from OCIF and would greatly appreciate it. On behalf of the SUTDents, thank you so much for your undersding. Feel free to reach out to me for any further clarification. 

 

Yours sincerely,

The Singapore Green Plan 2030 (Green Plan) is a national sustainability movement that seeks to rally bold and collective action to tackle climate change. It prises 5 key pillars (City in Nature, Energy Reset, Sustainable Living, Green Economy, Resilient Future), and sets out concrete sectoral plans and targets for the next 10 years. The Green Plan is a living plan, wch will evolve and be refined over time. One of its key priorities is to mobilise and empower the Public, Private and People sectors and Singaporeans to co-create solutions for sustainability. As part of ts national engagement process, the National Youth Council is planning organising a series of Singapore Green Plan Conversation to hear studentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ views on the Green Plan, and how we can build a city of green possibilities together, wle taking into account Singapore's context.

Ã¢â‚¬Å“To cut down on the time it takes to discover these new materials, researchers at MIT have developed a data-driven process that uses macne learning to optimize new 3D printing materials with multiple characteristics, like toughness and pression strength. Ã¢â‚¬Â

Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Royal Institute of British Arctects (RIBA) awarded the 2021 Stephen Lawrence Prize to Tonkin LiuÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Water Tower, an adaptive reuse project wch converts a disused industrial structure in the countryside into a residential space.Ã¢â‚¬Â

Ã¢â‚¬Å“The study shows how mixing multiple molecules Ã¢â‚¬â€œ up to eight at a time Ã¢â‚¬â€œ can result in a material that performs as well as the best currently known glass formers.Ã¢â‚¬Â

Ã¢â‚¬Å“In a new study, Gary Moore and s research group explore different approaches to catalysis, a chemical process that plays an essential role in biological reactions, as well as many industrial applications.Ã¢â‚¬Â

Ã¢â‚¬Å“A new optical switch is, at 1 trillion operations per second, between 100 and 1,000 times faster than today's leading mercial electronic transistors, research that may one day help lead to a new generation of puters based on light instead of electricity, say scientists in Russia and at IBM.Ã¢â‚¬Â

Ã¢â‚¬Å“An international team of researchers announced ts week that it has finally pleted the mathematical characterization of ShubnikovÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s magnetic and nonmagnetic crystal symmetry groups.Ã¢â‚¬Â

Ã¢â‚¬Å“A new kind of fiber developed by researchers at MIT and in Sweden can be made into clotng that senses how much it is being stretched or pressed, and then provides immediate tactile feedback in the form of pressure, lateral stretch, or vibration. Such fabrics, the team suggests, could be used in garments that help train singers or athletes to better control their breatng, or that help patients recovering from disease or surgery to recover their breatng patterns.Ã¢â‚¬Â

Ã¢â‚¬Å“One potential cost-effective way to sustain ageing concrete subjected to harsh environmental conditions is to externally coat the material with fiber reinforced polymer posites. But few studies have looked at the durability of such strengthening. Now, researchers from Korea and the USA conduct a 13-year long experiment to find out.Ã¢â‚¬Â

Ã¢â‚¬Å“Noninvasive glucose monitoring devices are not currently mercially available in the United States, so people with diabetes must collect blood samples or use sensors embedded under the skin to measure their blood sugar levels. Now, with a new wearable device created by Penn State researchers, less intrusive glucose monitoring could bee the norm.Ã¢â‚¬Â

Ã¢â‚¬Å“The team was able to aceve ts device alongside with the recent emergence of macne learning concepts into photonics, wch promises unprecedented capabilities and system performance.Ã¢â‚¬Â

Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ts work with Mini Cheetah has to contend with Earth gravity, however, wch puts some fairly severe time constraints on the whole reorientation tng with the penalty for failure being a smashed-up robot rather than just a weird bounce. When we asked the ETH Zurich researchers what might improve the performance of SpaceBok, t told us that ""heavy shoes would definitely help,"" and it looks like the folks from Notre Dame had the same idea, wch t were able to implement on Mini Cheetah.Ã¢â‚¬Â

Ã¢â‚¬Å“The collective behaviors of ants, honeybees and birds to solve problems and overe obstacles is sometng researchers have developed in aerial and underwater robotics. Developing small-scale swarm robots with the capability to traverse plex terrain, however, es with a unique set of challenges.Ã¢â‚¬Â

 EPF: Class of 2024 Graduation Video Montage," ,

 

We will need to hold on to the review of ts EPF.

 

There will be updates on fifth row advisory and safe management measures. You will then need to indicate the new SMM in your RA for EHSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clearance.

 

We are unable to review the EPF and RA for now since current SMM may be obsolete soon.

Have you watched the Class of 2021 Graduation Video Montage? Did you use boxes of tissue to wipe your tears up because it's just too toucng? If you did, you're not alone because me too (excluding the tissue part)! If you haven't, what are you waiting for, prepare a tissue box and watch it here <www.youtube/watch?v=vZ8dc9Jwp0s&t=2s> !

 

Continuing the great legacy Faheem, Adam and the team aceved, Noah, Sihan, Aretha, n Shao and I are motivated to continue to bring smiles to people. We felt that it would be meaningful to have a video montage dedicated to our batch with all the memories of having supper together, stang up till dawn and pleting 3.007 project. Thus, we are embarking on ts project, the Class of 2024 Graduation Video Montage, with an EPF and RAF. 

 

Similar to their video, we will be asking interviewees a question once in Term 3, Term 5/6, Term 8 (when we graduate). For editing purposes, we would ask 3 questions and pick the best response out of the 3 for the video montage.

To answer your concerns on our SMM, I have created a document with the measures that we will implement during the filming. I've submitted the PDPA form and include the clause in the sign-up form as well. $100 would be requested from Ine Fund to purchase props if filming requires. If it's not used, we would prepare a gift of token for the interviewees at the end of Term 8. No ine will be generated from ts project.





It would be good if you can advise on what are some other locations we can consider and wch areas are forbidden. For filming in hostel, we would seek Office of Housing approval to film in mon areas (like benches, study room, recreational room and interviewee's room). As it's a short period of time only (15min slot per interviewee) in mostly mon area (Jackie Chan Pavillion, Canteen...), is venue booking required?

 

Sorry for the long message!! I hope the informative message will clear any doubts you have. Feel free to clarify the information if it's unclear. Hope to seek your approval on ts event. 

 

Have a great day!

 Virtual help sessions for MU 
 
 all (bcced),

I am happy to do virtual help sessions for MU in recess week on Wed, Thurs, or Fri afternoons (prefer not early mornings) if anyone is interested. If so - do get together with some friends (or all those in the cohort who are interested), and do let me know. 

PS. I do not (or rather we do not) have your exam papers - t are all with James, so do contact m if you want a review.

Virtual help sessions for MU," all (bcced),

I am happy to do virtual help sessions for MU in recess week on Wed, Thurs, or Fri afternoons (prefer not early mornings) if anyone is interested. If so - do get together with some friends (or all those in the cohort who are interested), and do let me know. 

PS. I do not (or rather we do not) have your exam papers - t are all with James, so do contact m if you want a review.

  Request for extension of cohort classroom access

 

 Bee Foong, 

 

Thank you for the response! Could I check if there's any follow-up or update on ts?

 

Recently, more Term 1 and 3 students approached me sharing about the lack of spaces and the increasing workload from projects. We undersd the school's concerns. Please be assured that students returning to campus will conduct ART weekly as well as abide by the restrictions. 

 

Once again, thank you for the hard work and dedication. 

 

Yours sincerely,

 

 

P.S. With  to the Term 3 class fund, would there be an official email informing the new classes about it? From what I observed, not alot of classes know about it yet and it's approacng end of the term too.

 Request for extension of cohort classroom access

 

To whom it may concern,

 

IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m  , a term 3 student. I'm writing in  to the opening hours of the cohort classrooms.

First of all, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the offices for making physical classes possible during ts tough period. 

 

As projects, like 1D and 2D, are kicking in, I've received feedback from my fellow batchmates that t would like an extension of classroom access till 10pm for subsequent weeks (Week 6 to 14). An example would be for 10.023 Designing Energy Systems students, groups are building physical prototypes, like a peltier fridge and a solar powered device. Such prototyping heavy projects are difficult to do without meeting physically. Furthermore, as many Term 3 students do not stay in hostel, t can't access the group study room and school campus is the only alternative for them. Thus, we would like to seek your kind assisce to extend the hours. 

 

If we're given the extension, we would ensure safe management measures (SMM) will be strictly abided, such as submitting our ART results for weekly campus access and remaining in our groups of 2 for Week 6 and groups of 5 for subsequent weeks. In addition, we undersd OCIF's potential consideration of the electricity wastage. Thus, we are agreeable on working on just turning on the classroom fans, as long as access is granted.

 

Lastly, I thought that it would be nice if ts extension could be provided for the Term 1 students as well, since t are starting on projects. 

 

Thus, we would like to seek the approval from OCIF and would greatly appreciate it. On behalf of the SUTDents, thank you so much for your undersding. Feel free to reach out to me for any further clarification. 

 

Yours sincerely,

 

"
2021 September Term - 10.022 : Modelling Uncertainty: Modelling Uncertainty Week 8," students,

- Please be reminded that Homework 3 and the 1D project are both available now. T are due after recess (on 3 Nov and 12 Nov respectively).

- It is ghly probable that the second half of the term will continue to be conducted physically. Please remember to take the ART test before returning to campus.

- For some of the cohorts, the Weeks 8 and 9 timetables will be slightly different due to makeup classes, so please check your timetable carefully.

- I have been handling quite a few requests regarding exam viewing etc. In accordance with the policy given in the course information, no such requests will be considered after tomorrow (since it will be 1 week after the release of the scores).

Best wishes,

James

We will need to hold on to the review of ts EPF.

 

There will be updates on fifth row advisory and safe management measures. You will then need to indicate the new SMM in your RA for EHSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clearance.

 

We are unable to review the EPF and RA for now since current SMM may be obsolete soon.

Have you watched the Class of 2021 Graduation Video Montage? Did you use boxes of tissue to wipe your tears up because it's just too toucng? If you did, you're not alone because me too (excluding the tissue part)! If you haven't, what are you waiting for, prepare a tissue box and watch it here <www.youtube/watch?v=vZ8dc9Jwp0s&t=2s> !

 

Continuing the great legacy Faheem, Adam and the team aceved, Noah, Sihan, Aretha, n Shao and I are motivated to continue to bring smiles to people. We felt that it would be meaningful to have a video montage dedicated to our batch with all the memories of having supper together, stang up till dawn and pleting 3.007 project. Thus, we are embarking on ts project, the Class of 2024 Graduation Video Montage, with an EPF and RAF. 

 

Similar to their video, we will be asking interviewees a question once in Term 3, Term 5/6, Term 8 (when we graduate). For editing purposes, we would ask 3 questions and pick the best response out of the 3 for the video montage. 

 

Here are the materials:

1.

To answer your concerns on our SMM, I have created a document with the measures that we will implement during the filming. I've submitted the PDPA form and include the clause in the sign-up form as well. $100 would be requested from Ine Fund to purchase props if filming requires. If it's not used, we would prepare a gift of token for the interviewees at the end of Term 8. No ine will be generated from ts project.

 

It would be good if you can advise on what are some other locations we can consider and wch areas are forbidden. For filming in hostel, we would seek Office of Housing approval to film in mon areas (like benches, study room, recreational room and interviewee's room). As it's a short period of time only (15min slot per interviewee) in mostly mon area (Jackie Chan Pavillion, Canteen...), is venue booking required?

 

Sorry for the long message!! I hope the informative message will clear any doubts you have. Feel free to clarify the information if it's unclear. Hope to seek your approval on ts event. 

 

Have a great day!

 

Yours sincerely,

Ã¢â‚¬Å“A research led by scientists from City University of Hong Kong (CityU) has successfully developed a super-strong, ghly ductile and super-light tiium-based alloy using additive manufacturing, monly known as 3D printing. Their findings open up a new pathway to design alloys with unprecedented structures and properties for various structural applications.  Ã¢â‚¬Â

Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â¦scientists studied rats in a virtual reality maze. Wle observing the activities of large numbers of individual neurons in each animalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ppocampus, the scientists discovered responses in those neurons that revealed a specific mechanism for navigationÃ¢â‚¬Â¦The study could help explain why people with damage to the ppocampus struggle not just with so-called spatial tasks, like finding their way home or locating a lost set of keys, but also with memory tasks, such as recalling what t had for lunch or whether t took their daily medication.Ã¢â‚¬Â

Ã¢â‚¬Å“Tap water produces a natural protective seld against harmful microplastics, wch can help prevent household products such as plastic kettles from releasing them.Ã¢â‚¬Â

Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sure, you could attach two screens with a nge and call a cell phone Ã¢â‚¬Å“foldable,Ã¢â‚¬Â but what if you could roll it up and put it in your wallet? Or stretch it around your wrist to wear it as a watch?Ã¢â‚¬Â

Ã¢â‚¬Å“Researchers from the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) have developed a shape-sfting material that can take and hold any possible shape, paving the way for a new type of multifunctional material that could be used in a range of applications, from robotics and biotechnology to arctecture.Ã¢â‚¬Â

Ã¢â‚¬Å“Researchers proposed a single-layer hydrogel artificial skin, termed Ã¢â‚¬ËœSHARKÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, that bines gh stretchability, self-healing properties, and ultrasensitive mechanical sensing.Ã¢â‚¬Â

Ã¢â‚¬Å“Recent work has shown that bagworm silk is superior to spider silk in both strength and flexibility. Building on these findings, a research team at the University of Tsukuba, led by Professor romasa Goto, has harnessed the strength of bagworm silk to produce a strong, flexible, conductive fiber. Ts research may lead to new flexible electronic devices, such as wearable electronic materials.Ã¢â‚¬Â

Ã¢â‚¬Å“Using sopsticated microscopy and putational analysis, Texas A&M University researchers have now validated the merit of a water purification technology that uses electricity to remove and inactivate an assortment of waterborne viruses. T said the yet-to-be-implemented water purification strategy could add another level of safety against pathogens that cause gastrointestinal ailments and other infections in humans.Ã¢â‚¬Â

Our event (A Collage Network) aims to motivate students by allowing students to send motivational messages and images to each other. The event will be split into 2 parts, an online and a physical. For the online ponent, we will be allowing the entire school to send their encouragement here padlet/ROOT_Welfare3/t1f3ozzfypy278z2 <apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook/?url=%3A%2F%2Fpadlet%2FROOT_Welfare3%2Ft1f3ozzfypy278z2Students&data=04%7C01%7C_%40.sutd..%7C34b541c0e5344474491008d99aaf6612%7C3476b776e9904f72b95062489831623d%7C0%7C0%7C637710900683118611%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=wugm4zuuQ3UZZZv3h0RNVY49U%2BmuPIxoEjG5XS%2FrRao%3D&reserved=0> .

 

Students can see each other messages through the same link. We intend to have the online munity board up from 15th November to 26th of November (Week 10 and 11).  At the end of the event on the 26th of November, my team intends to make a video collage of all the messages written and to display the video collage on the TV in the school canteen. We will only be able to send you the video on the 28th of November. Therefore, I would also like to check if there is an estimate on how long it would take before the video can be displayed on the tv as I undersd that the video needs to be approved first. We would like to display the collage video until the 17th of December (Week 14) when finals are over.

 

For the physical ponent, it will be targeted to the Term 1  students. We would like to paste wteboard sheets onto each Term 1 Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s classroom doors such that t can decorate and write motivational messages for each other for class bonding and to motivate the cohort. I have attached a layout of where we will be pasting the wteboard sheets in ts email. We would like to leave the wteboards from Week 11 till Week 14 until finals are over.

 

I've attached the Event Proposal Form as well as the Risk Assessment in ts email. If you have any further question you can always contact me. Thank you.

"
2021 September Term - 10.022 : Modelling Uncertainty: Modelling Uncertainty Week 8 (part 2)," students,

Thanks for your midterm survey ments. I would like to address two issues raised the

(1) Due dates of the remaining homework sets. Here t a

HW4: due 5pm, Fri 19 Nov (Week 10)

HW5: due 5pm, Wed 1 Dec (Week 12)

HW6: due 5pm, Mon 13 Dec (Week 14)

You already know the due dates of HW3, 1D and 2D, so now you know all the import dates.

(2) Extra practice. There are many options:

- Weekly extra questions. Even though there are not many questions, each question is carefully written to reinforce your undersding, and the format is similar to the exam questions. Answers are also provided (Week 6 answers are ing shortly).

- The textbook, wch you can find in the library and online. Relevant chapters of the book contain many basic examples and drill-type questions; answers to odd-numbered questions can be found at the back of the book. (Please note that the book uses slightly different notations from the slides.)

- I have opened 2 Cerebry sessions (class code: SUTD-MU) on the basics of probability and integration respectively. Disclaimers: the sessions are not graded (so do not prioritize your time on them); not all integration questions are relevant (some are much harder than what weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll need); the basics of probability are still relevant to the rest of the course (however, some questions are about cards); I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t write the questions (so expect wording issues; the exams will be much better worded); I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t guarantee the correctness of all solutions, and some are indeed suboptimal (but the sessions had been tested on an earlier course, so the solutions are very likely to be correct).

Best wishes,

James

 Requesting for an event approval for Week 11 

 

To Office of Student Life and Events,

 

Good afternoon, I am Cheng Wei Xuan from ROOT and I am writing ts email with  to requesting approval for my teamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s event. 

 

Our event (A Collage Network) aims to motivate students by allowing students to send motivational messages and images to each other. The event will be split into 2 parts, an online and a physical. For the online ponent, we will be allowing the entire school to send their encouragement here padlet/ROOT_Welfare3/t1f3ozzfypy278z2 <apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook/?url=%3A%2F%2Fpadlet%2FROOT_Welfare3%2Ft1f3ozzfypy278z2Students&data=04%7C01%7C_%40.sutd..%7C8f42f757eab9415c3a0308d99af60d5e%7C3476b776e9904f72b95062489831623d%7C0%7C0%7C637711203846580901%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=gez%2Fj%2BHP%2BcE1WoB6DsCJoP1AHQoibMZYTSMnT06pbqU%3D&reserved=0> .

 

Students can see each other messages through the same link. We intend to have the online munity board up from 15th November to 26th of November (Week 10 and 11).  At the end of the event on the 26th of November, my team intends to make a video collage of all the messages written and to display the video collage on the TV in the school canteen. We will only be able to send you the video on the 28th of November. Therefore, I would also like to check if there is an estimate on how long it would take before the video can be displayed on the tv as I undersd that the video needs to be approved first. We would like to display the collage video until the 17th of December (Week 14) when finals are over.

 

For the physical ponent, it will be targeted to the Term 1  students. We would like to paste wteboard sheets onto each Term 1 Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s classroom doors such that t can decorate and write motivational messages for each other for class bonding and to motivate the cohort. I have attached a layout of where we will be pasting the wteboard sheets in ts email. We would like to leave the wteboards from Week 11 till Week 14 until finals are over.

 

I've attached the Event Proposal Form as well as the Risk Assessment in ts email. If you have any further question you can always contact me. Thank you. 

 

Yours sincerely, 

Cheng Wei Xuan

We will need to seek clearance from OCIF and OH for your filming. Before that, we need to clear your RA with EHS.

 

You may have to postpone your activity till all clearance has been sought. We will try our best to expedite.

For those locations ghlighted in Red, t are munal area in hostel where only hostel resident can enter. Thus, I will oversee those locations. Do advice on the venue booking.

 Crystal,

 

Here's the update RAF. 

 

With  to venue booking, I would need more time to gather the list of venue and timings. Currently, some tentative places include ROOT Cove, Hostel Room, Jackie Chan Pavilion, Hostel mon area, Pond at hostel, Cohort Classroom. I will submit it together with the participants clearance by 1 Nov. Could I check if filming in hostel mon area and resident's room will require OCIF or OH approving?

 

Thank you!

 

Yours sincerely,

We will need to hold on to the review of ts EPF.

 

There will be updates on fifth row advisory and safe management measures. You will then need to indicate the new SMM in your RA for EHSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clearance.

 

We are unable to review the EPF and RA for now since current SMM may be obsolete soon.

Have you watched the Class of 2021 Graduation Video Montage? Did you use boxes of tissue to wipe your tears up because it's just too toucng? If you did, you're not alone because me too (excluding the tissue part)! If you haven't, what are you waiting for, prepare a tissue box and watch it here <www.youtube/watch?v=vZ8dc9Jwp0s&t=2s> !

 

Continuing the great legacy Faheem, Adam and the team aceved, Noah, Sihan, Aretha, n Shao and I are motivated to continue to bring smiles to people. We felt that it would be meaningful to have a video montage dedicated to our batch with all the memories of having supper together, stang up till dawn and pleting 3.007 project. Thus, we are embarking on ts project, the Class of 2024 Graduation Video Montage, with an EPF and RAF. 

 

Similar to their video, we will be asking interviewees a question once in Term 3, Term 5/6, Term 8 (when we graduate). For editing purposes, we would ask 3 questions and pick the best response out of the 3 for the video montage. 

 

Here are the materials:

1.

To answer your concerns on our SMM, I have created a document with the measures that we will implement during the filming. I've submitted the PDPA form and include the clause in the sign-up form as well. $100 would be requested from Ine Fund to purchase props if filming requires. If it's not used, we would prepare a gift of token for the interviewees at the end of Term 8. No ine will be generated from ts project.

 

It would be good if you can advise on what are some other locations we can consider and wch areas are forbidden. For filming in hostel, we would seek Office of Housing approval to film in mon areas (like benches, study room, recreational room and interviewee's room). As it's a short period of time only (15min slot per interviewee) in mostly mon area (Jackie Chan Pavillion, Canteen...), is venue booking required?

 

Sorry for the long message!! I hope the informative message will clear any doubts you have. Feel free to clarify the information if it's unclear. Hope to seek your approval on ts event. 

 

Have a great day!

 

Yours sincerely,

 

Publicity Director of Productions

 great to see all of you

 

 Adele, Benjamin, Jie Lin and Li Ling, 

 

Great to see all of today. Ã°Å¸ËœÂ

 

Adele and Jie Lin, I haven't had the chance to ask how you are doing so far. Hope you are doing ok. 

 

I know some of you are doing DDW so I attach some books wch I hope will help you. I undersd that there is no course text for DDW? 

 

Algorithms is not an easy subject and though these books are probably too advanced, I tnk having the details on hand might be helpful. 

 

In CS, Algorithms is a bona fide field on its own. I know the author when he gave a series of guest lectures in Israel. 

 

The trip was by accident as I went into the wrong seminar room. Haha!! But I found Tim to be a great municator. For the parts I could undersd, I thought it was well presented. Feel free to differ though. Ã°Å¸ËœÂ

 

First two are attached. The other two will e in another email. 

 

Blessings 

Bernie

 Crystal,

 

Here's the update RAF. 

 

With  to venue booking, I would need more time to gather the list of venue and timings. Currently, some tentative places include ROOT Cove, Hostel Room, Jackie Chan Pavilion, Hostel mon area, Pond at hostel, Cohort Classroom. I will submit it together with the participants clearance by 1 Nov. Could I check if filming in hostel mon area and resident's room will require OCIF or OH approving?

 

Thank you!

 

Yours sincerely,

We will need to hold on to the review of ts EPF.

 

There will be updates on fifth row advisory and safe management measures. You will then need to indicate the new SMM in your RA for EHSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clearance.

 

We are unable to review the EPF and RA for now since current SMM may be obsolete soon.

Have you watched the Class of 2021 Graduation Video Montage? Did you use boxes of tissue to wipe your tears up because it's just too toucng? If you did, you're not alone because me too (excluding the tissue part)! If you haven't, what are you waiting for, prepare a tissue box and watch it here <www.youtube/watch?v=vZ8dc9Jwp0s&t=2s> !

 

Continuing the great legacy Faheem, Adam and the team aceved, Noah, Sihan, Aretha, n Shao and I are motivated to continue to bring smiles to people. We felt that it would be meaningful to have a video montage dedicated to our batch with all the memories of having supper together, stang up till dawn and pleting 3.007 project. Thus, we are embarking on ts project, the Class of 2024 Graduation Video Montage, with an EPF and RAF. 

 

Similar to their video, we will be asking interviewees a question once in Term 3, Term 5/6, Term 8 (when we graduate). For editing purposes, we would ask 3 questions and pick the best response out of the 3 for the video montage.

To answer your concerns on our SMM, I have created a document with the measures that we will implement during the filming. I've submitted the PDPA form and include the clause in the sign-up form as well. $100 would be requested from Ine Fund to purchase props if filming requires. If it's not used, we would prepare a gift of token for the interviewees at the end of Term 8. No ine will be generated from ts project.

 

It would be good if you can advise on what are some other locations we can consider and wch areas are forbidden. For filming in hostel, we would seek Office of Housing approval to film in mon areas (like benches, study room, recreational room and interviewee's room). As it's a short period of time only (15min slot per interviewee) in mostly mon area (Jackie Chan Pavillion, Canteen...), is venue booking required?

 

Sorry for the long message!! I hope the informative message will clear any doubts you have. Feel free to clarify the information if it's unclear. Hope to seek your approval on ts event. 

 

Have a great day!

 

Yours sincerely,

 

Publicity Director of Productions

 Requesting for an event approval for Week 11 

 

To Office of Student Life and Events,

 

Good afternoon, I am Cheng Wei Xuan from ROOT and I am writing ts email with  to requesting approval for my teamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s event. 

 

Our event (A Collage Network) aims to motivate students by allowing students to send motivational messages and images to each other. The event will be split into 2 parts, an online and a physical. For the online ponent, we will be allowing the entire school to send their encouragement here padlet/ROOT_Welfare3/t1f3ozzfypy278z2 <apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook/?url=%3A%2F%2Fpadlet%2FROOT_Welfare3%2Ft1f3ozzfypy278z2Students&data=04%7C01%7C_%40.sutd..%7C5459dec28c8f48fd23fd08d99eb8d1e3%7C3476b776e9904f72b95062489831623d%7C0%7C0%7C637715338909939220%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=Gqq6%2FFKXf9%2B%2FR4DcHZSIoEJlHTEXQl2%2Fx0KFFEFiUO0%3D&reserved=0> .

 

Students can see each other messages through the same link. We intend to have the online munity board up from 15th November to 26th of November (Week 10 and 11).  At the end of the event on the 26th of November, my team intends to make a video collage of all the messages written and to display the video collage on the TV in the school canteen. We will only be able to send you the video on the 28th of November. Therefore, I would also like to check if there is an estimate on how long it would take before the video can be displayed on the tv as I undersd that the video needs to be approved first. We would like to display the collage video until the 17th of December (Week 14) when finals are over.

 

For the physical ponent, it will be targeted to the Term 1  students. We would like to paste wteboard sheets onto each Term 1 Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s classroom doors such that t can decorate and write motivational messages for each other for class bonding and to motivate the cohort. I have attached a layout of where we will be pasting the wteboard sheets in ts email. We would like to leave the wteboards from Week 11 till Week 14 until finals are over.

 

I've attached the Event Proposal Form as well as the Risk Assessment in ts email. If you have any further question you can always contact me. Thank you. 

 

Yours sincerely, 

Cheng Wei Xuan

 Requesting for an event approval for Week 11 

 

To Office of Student Life and Events,

 

Good afternoon, I am Cheng Wei Xuan from ROOT and I am writing ts email with  to requesting approval for my teamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s event. 

 

Our event (A Collage Network) aims to motivate students by allowing students to send motivational messages and images to each other. The event will be split into 2 parts, an online and a physical. For the online ponent, we will be allowing the entire school to send their encouragement here padlet/ROOT_Welfare3/t1f3ozzfypy278z2 <apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook/?url=%3A%2F%2Fpadlet%2FROOT_Welfare3%2Ft1f3ozzfypy278z2Students&data=04%7C01%7C_%40.sutd..%7Cccf46723aa704035170e08d99f596703%7C3476b776e9904f72b95062489831623d%7C0%7C0%7C637716028715289256%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=pPhc%2BdKwllmsL6h4Py2VaUHQfV9LIKV3dx8iQ1zN%2F9c%3D&reserved=0> .

 

Students can see each other messages through the same link. We intend to have the online munity board up from 15th November to 26th of November (Week 10 and 11).  At the end of the event on the 26th of November, my team intends to make a video collage of all the messages written and to display the video collage on the TV in the school canteen. We will only be able to send you the video on the 28th of November. Therefore, I would also like to check if there is an estimate on how long it would take before the video can be displayed on the tv as I undersd that the video needs to be approved first. We would like to display the collage video until the 17th of December (Week 14) when finals are over.

 

For the physical ponent, it will be targeted to the Term 1  students. We would like to paste wteboard sheets onto each Term 1 Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s classroom doors such that t can decorate and write motivational messages for each other for class bonding and to motivate the cohort. I have attached a layout of where we will be pasting the wteboard sheets in ts email. We would like to leave the wteboards from Week 11 till Week 14 until finals are over.

 

I've attached the Event Proposal Form as well as the Risk Assessment in ts email. If you have any further question you can always contact me. Thank you. 

 

Yours sincerely, 

Cheng Wei Xuan

 Floor Cleaning Email

 

 Sir/Madam,

 

Today, my floor had floor cleaning, but I didn't receive any email about it. Could I check if any email was sent out or was it just me who didn't receive it? 

 

My floor has quite several shoes along the corridor. As a House Guardian, I wasn't able to inform them about it earlier to keep their shoe in. As a result, the cleaner had to keep all the shoes wch is additional task to their job. Really sorry about it! 

 

Hope to hear from you soon. Have a great Deepavali holiday.

 

Yours sincerely,

For the email draft, if you intend to send ts out before the physical wteboard section is cleared, you may want to indicate that ts is still TBC at ts point of time.

 

We do not have TVs for loan. The 2 weeksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ timeline includes the process of vetting of videos, editing (if any) and clearance for the use of campus TV wch involves multiple departments Ã¢â‚¬â€œ OSL, Marketing, OCIF and IT. The timeline is actually quite reasonable and if all clearance can be obtained earlier, I will definitely inform you on that.

 Requesting for an event approval for Week 11 

 

To Office of Student Life and Events,

 

Good afternoon, I am Cheng Wei Xuan from ROOT and I am writing ts email with  to requesting approval for my teamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s event. 

 

Our event (A Collage Network) aims to motivate students by allowing students to send motivational messages and images to each other. The event will be split into 2 parts, an online and a physical. For the online ponent, we will be allowing the entire school to send their encouragement here padlet/ROOT_Welfare3/t1f3ozzfypy278z2 <apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook/?url=%3A%2F%2Fpadlet%2FROOT_Welfare3%2Ft1f3ozzfypy278z2Students&data=04%7C01%7C_%40.sutd..%7Cf1b4d38e6df54048068108d9a0312c1b%7C3476b776e9904f72b95062489831623d%7C0%7C0%7C637716955310524549%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=O2qrmlW8pvDAUs44bdcbmQ3EQT%2FRnguw50b4nKGUYuI%3D&reserved=0> .

 

Students can see each other messages through the same link. We intend to have the online munity board up from 15th November to 26th of November (Week 10 and 11).  At the end of the event on the 26th of November, my team intends to make a video collage of all the messages written and to display the video collage on the TV in the school canteen. We will only be able to send you the video on the 28th of November. Therefore, I would also like to check if there is an estimate on how long it would take before the video can be displayed on the tv as I undersd that the video needs to be approved first. We would like to display the collage video until the 17th of December (Week 14) when finals are over.

 

For the physical ponent, it will be targeted to the Term 1  students. We would like to paste wteboard sheets onto each Term 1 Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s classroom doors such that t can decorate and write motivational messages for each other for class bonding and to motivate the cohort. I have attached a layout of where we will be pasting the wteboard sheets in ts email. We would like to leave the wteboards from Week 11 till Week 14 until finals are over.

 

I've attached the Event Proposal Form as well as the Risk Assessment in ts email. If you have any further question you can always contact me. Thank you. 

 

Yours sincerely, 

Cheng Wei Xuan

  Term 1 Class Fund Claim Procre

Below is a summary of the fund claims process as a refresher. Ts information was previously  shared with your batch of cohort student excos (Chair, Deputy Chair and Treasurer) and cohort advisors during one of the excos and cohort advisors  dialogue session in  Term 1, AY2020. Hope ts helps. Thanks.

  Term 1 Class Fund Claim Procre

 

 ,

 

The students can spend the class fund of $250 for ts term even if t have not selected the treasurer yet. But t have to seek the approval from  the faculty / staff cohort advisor. We can only conduct the first exco meeting when all the cohorts excos are elected. Most of the  cohort advisors are experience and t have also been cohort advisors for last few years. Thus t would be able to  advise the class on the claims process  eg filling in the budget utilisation form and submitting the claims through the Concur system together with the receipts. We will conduct the briefing for the claims process during the first excos meeting. Meanwle students may consult their cohort advisors for advise on the claims  process before the first excos dialogue session. For info the concur system is under Finance and if students required a detailed briefing on the system, we will need to seek FinanceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s help to conduct the briefing.

 

In all cases, please consult the faculty cohort advisors first. Most of them except for the new cohort advisors are very experienced and t would be able to advise the students  base on a case by case basis.

 

Let me know if you still encounter any problems.

 

Thanks

 Term 1 Class Fund Claim Procre

 

 Bee Fong,

 

The cohort advisors are interacting with the classes and noticed a problem happening with the class fund. As such, we would like to seek your clarification. 

 

Firstly, some Term 1 class are actually wanting to spend the money on welfare packs or class t-srt/jacket. However, t are unsure of the claim procre. I undersd that it could be due to some classes that hasn't settled the class mittee. If the concur briefing will not be conducted anytime soon, is it possible to clarify the procre on how classes can use the fund and claim it first? It'll be nice if you can share with us the concur slides so we can send to the treasurer to familiarise too.  

 

Secondly, for classes who hasn't select a class m, there could be a delay in their use of class fund as well. Can I check if there's a way for classes who hasn't select a class mittee to spend the class fund first? In another words, could you provide us the finance/claim procre on how to use class fund for classes who has a class m and for those who don't have one respectively? 

 

Lastly, when will the first cohort meeting for the class exco mittee and the concur briefing for the treasurer be? We're tnking that it'll be good to allow classes to settle down quickly since t only have 2 terms together (wch means almost 1/4 is over).

 

Thank you for the hard work arranging all the class matters in midst of ts pandemic! We really appreciate it Ã¢ÂÂ¤Ã¯Â¸Â

 

Have a great day ahead!

 

Yours sincerely,

 Crystal,

 

Here's the update RAF. 

 

With  to venue booking, I would need more time to gather the list of venue and timings. Currently, some tentative places include ROOT Cove, Hostel Room, Jackie Chan Pavilion, Hostel mon area, Pond at hostel, Cohort Classroom. I will submit it together with the participants clearance by 1 Nov. Could I check if filming in hostel mon area and resident's room will require OCIF or OH approving?

 

Thank you!

 

Yours sincerely,

We will need to hold on to the review of ts EPF.

 

There will be updates on fifth row advisory and safe management measures. You will then need to indicate the new SMM in your RA for EHSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clearance.

 

We are unable to review the EPF and RA for now since current SMM may be obsolete soon.

Have you watched the Class of 2021 Graduation Video Montage? Did you use boxes of tissue to wipe your tears up because it's just too toucng? If you did, you're not alone because me too (excluding the tissue part)! If you haven't, what are you waiting for, prepare a tissue box and watch it here <www.youtube/watch?v=vZ8dc9Jwp0s&t=2s> !

 

Continuing the great legacy Faheem, Adam and the team aceved, Noah, Sihan, Aretha, n Shao and I are motivated to continue to bring smiles to people. We felt that it would be meaningful to have a video montage dedicated to our batch with all the memories of having supper together, stang up till dawn and pleting 3.007 project. Thus, we are embarking on ts project, the Class of 2024 Graduation Video Montage, with an EPF and RAF. 

 

Similar to their video, we will be asking interviewees a question once in Term 3, Term 5/6, Term 8 (when we graduate). For editing purposes, we would ask 3 questions and pick the best response out of the 3 for the video montage.

To answer your concerns on our SMM, I have created a document with the measures that we will implement during the filming. I've submitted the PDPA form and include the clause in the sign-up form as well. $100 would be requested from Ine Fund to purchase props if filming requires. If it's not used, we would prepare a gift of token for the interviewees at the end of Term 8. No ine will be generated from ts project.

 

It would be good if you can advise on what are some other locations we can consider and wch areas are forbidden. For filming in hostel, we would seek Office of Housing approval to film in mon areas (like benches, study room, recreational room and interviewee's room). As it's a short period of time only (15min slot per interviewee) in mostly mon area (Jackie Chan Pavillion, Canteen...), is venue booking required?

 

Sorry for the long message!! I hope the informative message will clear any doubts you have. Feel free to clarify the information if it's unclear. Hope to seek your approval on ts event. 

 

Have a great day!

 

Yours sincerely,

 

Publicity Director of Productions

Good Morning, I'll take note of adding the TBC in the email if we are sending it to the school before the physical wteboards are approved. 

As for the TV, I undersd that the video will take 2 weeks to be verified and thus will only be available for showing after week 14. In that case, we'll change ts portion and display the video on ROOT social medias instead.

Thank you for your time.

 Wei Xuan,

 

For the email draft, if you intend to send ts out before the physical wteboard section is cleared, you may want to indicate that ts is still TBC at ts point of time.

 

We do not have TVs for loan. The 2 weeksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ timeline includes the process of vetting of videos, editing (if any) and clearance for the use of campus TV wch involves multiple departments Ã¢â‚¬â€œ OSL, Marketing, OCIF and IT. The timeline is actually quite reasonable and if all clearance can be obtained earlier, I will definitely inform you on that.

 Requesting for an event approval for Week 11 

 

To Office of Student Life and Events,

 

Good afternoon, I am Cheng Wei Xuan from ROOT and I am writing ts email with  to requesting approval for my teamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s event. 

 

Our event (A Collage Network) aims to motivate students by allowing students to send motivational messages and images to each other. The event will be split into 2 parts, an online and a physical. For the online ponent, we will be allowing the entire school to send their encouragement here padlet/ROOT_Welfare3/t1f3ozzfypy278z2 <apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook/?url=%3A%2F%2Fpadlet%2FROOT_Welfare3%2Ft1f3ozzfypy278z2Students&data=04%7C01%7C_%40.sutd..%7C5a9bc65f097644fb59ff08d9a0d6ddb2%7C3476b776e9904f72b95062489831623d%7C0%7C0%7C637717666988815907%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=CGrs6%2Ff8vz%2F4xSms%2BtB%2BQC5LRYpQlGE5D7jcLQNICRs%3D&reserved=0> .

 

Students can see each other messages through the same link. We intend to have the online munity board up from 15th November to 26th of November (Week 10 and 11).  At the end of the event on the 26th of November, my team intends to make a video collage of all the messages written and to display the video collage on the TV in the school canteen. We will only be able to send you the video on the 28th of November. Therefore, I would also like to check if there is an estimate on how long it would take before the video can be displayed on the tv as I undersd that the video needs to be approved first. We would like to display the collage video until the 17th of December (Week 14) when finals are over.

 

For the physical ponent, it will be targeted to the Term 1  students. We would like to paste wteboard sheets onto each Term 1 Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s classroom doors such that t can decorate and write motivational messages for each other for class bonding and to motivate the cohort. I have attached a layout of where we will be pasting the wteboard sheets in ts email. We would like to leave the wteboards from Week 11 till Week 14 until finals are over.

 

I've attached the Event Proposal Form as well as the Risk Assessment in ts email. If you have any further question you can always contact me. Thank you. 

 

Yours sincerely, 

Cheng Wei Xuan

"
 EPF: ROOT A Collage Network,"To Crystal,

 

Good afternoon, I am writing ts email to request if we can start our online event earlier. As the online padlet has been approved, our team would like to request if we can start it on Week 9 (8th November Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 26th November) instead on Week 10 as we feel like running the event for a longer period will be more impactful. Looking forward to your reply.

 Requesting for an event approval for Week 11 

 

To Office of Student Life and Events,

 

Good afternoon, I am Cheng Wei Xuan from ROOT and I am writing ts email with  to requesting approval for my teamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s event. 

 

Our event (A Collage Network) aims to motivate students by allowing students to send motivational messages and images to each other. The event will be split into 2 parts, an online and a physical. For the online ponent, we will be allowing the entire school to send their encouragement here padlet/ROOT_Welfare3/t1f3ozzfypy278z2 <apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook/?url=%3A%2F%2Fpadlet%2FROOT_Welfare3%2Ft1f3ozzfypy278z2Students&data=04%7C01%7C_%40.sutd..%7C10bd8cc2765e4fdb18ce08d9a1bd7aca%7C3476b776e9904f72b95062489831623d%7C0%7C0%7C637718657477110799%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=3Uos1apzK%2FvXteXrujuuyVLJphoNGFdDfZgbhwgs4wg%3D&reserved=0> .

 

Students can see each other messages through the same link. We intend to have the online munity board up from 15th November to 26th of November (Week 10 and 11).  At the end of the event on the 26th of November, my team intends to make a video collage of all the messages written and to display the video collage on the TV in the school canteen. We will only be able to send you the video on the 28th of November. Therefore, I would also like to check if there is an estimate on how long it would take before the video can be displayed on the tv as I undersd that the video needs to be approved first. We would like to display the collage video until the 17th of December (Week 14) when finals are over.

 

For the physical ponent, it will be targeted to the Term 1  students. We would like to paste wteboard sheets onto each Term 1 Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s classroom doors such that t can decorate and write motivational messages for each other for class bonding and to motivate the cohort. I have attached a layout of where we will be pasting the wteboard sheets in ts email. We would like to leave the wteboards from Week 11 till Week 14 until finals are over.

 

I've attached the Event Proposal Form as well as the Risk Assessment in ts email. If you have any further question you can always contact me. Thank you. 

 

Yours sincerely, 

Cheng Wei Xuan

 Crystal,

 

Here's the update RAF. 

 

With  to venue booking, I would need more time to gather the list of venue and timings. Currently, some tentative places include ROOT Cove, Hostel Room, Jackie Chan Pavilion, Hostel mon area, Pond at hostel, Cohort Classroom. I will submit it together with the participants clearance by 1 Nov. Could I check if filming in hostel mon area and resident's room will require OCIF or OH approving?

 

Thank you!

 

Yours sincerely,

We will need to hold on to the review of ts EPF.

 

There will be updates on fifth row advisory and safe management measures. You will then need to indicate the new SMM in your RA for EHSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clearance.

 

We are unable to review the EPF and RA for now since current SMM may be obsolete soon.

Have you watched the Class of 2021 Graduation Video Montage? Did you use boxes of tissue to wipe your tears up because it's just too toucng? If you did, you're not alone because me too (excluding the tissue part)! If you haven't, what are you waiting for, prepare a tissue box and watch it here <www.youtube/watch?v=vZ8dc9Jwp0s&t=2s> !

 

Continuing the great legacy Faheem, Adam and the team aceved, Noah, Sihan, Aretha, n Shao and I are motivated to continue to bring smiles to people. We felt that it would be meaningful to have a video montage dedicated to our batch with all the memories of having supper together, stang up till dawn and pleting 3.007 project. Thus, we are embarking on ts project, the Class of 2024 Graduation Video Montage, with an EPF and RAF. 

 

Similar to their video, we will be asking interviewees a question once in Term 3, Term 5/6, Term 8 (when we graduate). For editing purposes, we would ask 3 questions and pick the best response out of the 3 for the video montage.

To answer your concerns on our SMM, I have created a document with the measures that we will implement during the filming. I've submitted the PDPA form and include the clause in the sign-up form as well. $100 would be requested from Ine Fund to purchase props if filming requires. If it's not used, we would prepare a gift of token for the interviewees at the end of Term 8. No ine will be generated from ts project.

 

It would be good if you can advise on what are some other locations we can consider and wch areas are forbidden. For filming in hostel, we would seek Office of Housing approval to film in mon areas (like benches, study room, recreational room and interviewee's room). As it's a short period of time only (15min slot per interviewee) in mostly mon area (Jackie Chan Pavillion, Canteen...), is venue booking required?

 

Sorry for the long message!! I hope the informative message will clear any doubts you have. Feel free to clarify the information if it's unclear. Hope to seek your approval on ts event. 

 

Have a great day!

 

Yours sincerely,

We will need to seek clearance from OCIF and OH for your filming. Before that, we need to clear your RA with EHS.

 

You may have to postpone your activity till all clearance has been sought. We will try our best to expedite.

As I've chosen all outdoor location, I left the vaccination status blank. Attached is the declaration of participants, coloured grey are the photographer.

 

For venue booking:

*	Below are the filming locations. For those locations ghlighted in Yellow, t are in open area of Hostel that non-residents can enter. For those locations ghlighted in Red, t are munal area in hostel where only hostel resident can enter. Thus, I will oversee those locations. Do advice on the venue booking. 
*	To speed tngs up, if any venue is not available, we will be using Jackie Chan Pavilion (Dry Weather Plan) and Outside Albert Hong (Wet Weather Plan)

 Crystal,

 

Here's the update RAF. 

 

With  to venue booking, I would need more time to gather the list of venue and timings. Currently, some tentative places include ROOT Cove, Hostel Room, Jackie Chan Pavilion, Hostel mon area, Pond at hostel, Cohort Classroom. I will submit it together with the participants clearance by 1 Nov. Could I check if filming in hostel mon area and resident's room will require OCIF or OH approving?

 

Thank you!

 

Yours sincerely,

We will need to hold on to the review of ts EPF.

 

There will be updates on fifth row advisory and safe management measures. You will then need to indicate the new SMM in your RA for EHSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clearance.

 

We are unable to review the EPF and RA for now since current SMM may be obsolete soon.

Have you watched the Class of 2021 Graduation Video Montage? Did you use boxes of tissue to wipe your tears up because it's just too toucng? If you did, you're not alone because me too (excluding the tissue part)! If you haven't, what are you waiting for, prepare a tissue box and watch it here <www.youtube/watch?v=vZ8dc9Jwp0s&t=2s> !

 

Continuing the great legacy Faheem, Adam and the team aceved, Noah, Sihan, Aretha, n Shao and I are motivated to continue to bring smiles to people. We felt that it would be meaningful to have a video montage dedicated to our batch with all the memories of having supper together, stang up till dawn and pleting 3.007 project. Thus, we are embarking on ts project, the Class of 2024 Graduation Video Montage, with an EPF and RAF. 

 

Similar to their video, we will be asking interviewees a question once in Term 3, Term 5/6, Term 8 (when we graduate). For editing purposes, we would ask 3 questions and pick the best response out of the 3 for the video montage. 

 

Here are the materials:

To answer your concerns on our SMM, I have created a document with the measures that we will implement during the filming. I've submitted the PDPA form and include the clause in the sign-up form as well. $100 would be requested from Ine Fund to purchase props if filming requires. If it's not used, we would prepare a gift of token for the interviewees at the end of Term 8. No ine will be generated from ts project.

 

It would be good if you can advise on what are some other locations we can consider and wch areas are forbidden. For filming in hostel, we would seek Office of Housing approval to film in mon areas (like benches, study room, recreational room and interviewee's room). As it's a short period of time only (15min slot per interviewee) in mostly mon area (Jackie Chan Pavillion, Canteen...), is venue booking required?

To Crystal,

 

Good afternoon, I am writing ts email to request if we can start our online event earlier. As the online padlet has been approved, our team would like to request if we can start it on Week 9 (8th November Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 26th November) instead on Week 10 as we feel like running the event for a longer period will be more impactful. Looking forward to your reply.

 Wei Xuan,

 

For the email draft, if you intend to send ts out before the physical wteboard section is cleared, you may want to indicate that ts is still TBC at ts point of time.

 

We do not have TVs for loan. The 2 weeksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ timeline includes the process of vetting of videos, editing (if any) and clearance for the use of campus TV wch involves multiple departments Ã¢â‚¬â€œ OSL, Marketing, OCIF and IT. The timeline is actually quite reasonable and if all clearance can be obtained earlier, I will definitely inform you on that.

 Requesting for an event approval for Week 11 

 

To Office of Student Life and Events,

 

Good afternoon, I am Cheng Wei Xuan from ROOT and I am writing ts email with  to requesting approval for my teamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s event. 

 

Our event (A Collage Network) aims to motivate students by allowing students to send motivational messages and images to each other. The event will be split into 2 parts, an online and a physical. For the online ponent, we will be allowing the entire school to send their encouragement here padlet/ROOT_Welfare3/t1f3ozzfypy278z2 <apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook/?url=%3A%2F%2Fpadlet%2FROOT_Welfare3%2Ft1f3ozzfypy278z2Students&data=04%7C01%7C_%40.sutd..%7Cd159ba7153c64b8c1d3808d9a3668217%7C3476b776e9904f72b95062489831623d%7C0%7C0%7C637720482935395380%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=PbAvBk3XpmBcDTk7lm7zTH6J6YC08SFtkVGw8us6ex4%3D&reserved=0> .

 

Students can see each other messages through the same link. We intend to have the online munity board up from 15th November to 26th of November (Week 10 and 11).  At the end of the event on the 26th of November, my team intends to make a video collage of all the messages written and to display the video collage on the TV in the school canteen. We will only be able to send you the video on the 28th of November. Therefore, I would also like to check if there is an estimate on how long it would take before the video can be displayed on the tv as I undersd that the video needs to be approved first. We would like to display the collage video until the 17th of December (Week 14) when finals are over.

 

For the physical ponent, it will be targeted to the Term 1  students. We would like to paste wteboard sheets onto each Term 1 Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s classroom doors such that t can decorate and write motivational messages for each other for class bonding and to motivate the cohort. I have attached a layout of where we will be pasting the wteboard sheets in ts email. We would like to leave the wteboards from Week 11 till Week 14 until finals are over.

 

I've attached the Event Proposal Form as well as the Risk Assessment in ts email. If you have any further question you can always contact me. Thank you. 

 

Yours sincerely, 

Cheng Wei Xuan

	1. What is the accepted payment mode?

	2. How long is the lead time from confirming the design and number per size to collection? 

	3. Is delivery free?

 Events and OSL,

 

To celebrate the end of  term, we would be having a decorating srt event for the Term 3 SUTDents in Week 13-14 (because we can't have BBQ sadly). Ts idea is inspired by the signing on uniforms on the last day of secondary school. However, as we do not have uniforms, we will be giving wte srts out at $2 each. As the cost for 400 t-srts is more than $1k, my team have sent out quotation requests to different panies and would include it when requesting the purchase.

 



 

If we can get approval by next week and proceed with the sign-up form and purchase in time, here would be the ine collection details.

 

Details of ine collection: 

Start date of collection: 26 November 2021

End date of collection: 29 November 2021

Submit Wallet User(s) details 

Full Name (as per NRIC): Devans Jos 

Email (SUTD): 1005162 <mail1005162>  

Mobile Number: 93821256

 

We will adhere to the current SMM:

*	There should be at least 1-metre disce between individuals, or if ts is not possible, at least 2m discing between groups of no more than 5 persons for mask-on general activities. 

*	Attendance of each activity will be submitted to staff advisor witn the next day.  

*	No food and drink are to be supplied or consumed witn the activity area to ensure masks remain on (apart from bottled water). 

 

After confirming the collection date for the srts, I would send the names of the people helping at ROOT Cove to collect the srts and distribute to the class reps.

 

Hope to get your approval. Feel free to contact me at 97705194 for any clarification.

As we are unable to monitor the Ã¢â‚¬Å“eventÃ¢â‚¬Â since participants is given OTOT to get their friends to design their tsrts, I tnk I will review ts as sales of tsrt activity instead of an event. It seems that there will be no venue booking as well since there will be no distribution booth for the tsrt or specific venue for students to design the tsrt. Please let me know if ts is ok.

  Monthly meeting on cohort class matters

 

 Bee Foong, 

 

As the Term 3 students have math test on Wednesday 2.30-4.30pm, do excuse Issac, Arman and myself for the 17 November meeting. Really sorry about it! 

 

Also, can I check on how Term 3 classes can claim the $250? As most people are not aware about it, many haven't use it yet. Also, is it possible to use the fund to Grab bubble tea for all to drink after class since it is individually packed. 

 

Thank you!

 

Yours sincerely,

Sincere apologies on the very late response, as I was away for a month plus. 

I've looked through your proposal & email. 
After discussing with my team, we would like to suggest that the program be conducted online via Zoom instead.

In view of the Covid situation & the safe management measures, we've a limited number of volunteers wch we can allow into our centre, & t have to do the ART & declaration. Also, our cldren can only be in pairs, in accordance to the measures given by MSF.

Please let me know if converting the programme to online is feasible for you & your team. Alternatively, we can explore postponing ts to next year when more measures are eased.

Looking forward to hearing from you!
Thank you.

	 Geraldine,  

	Sorry for the late follow up on the event. Our school has approved the event and weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re good to go! IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve attached the proposal in the email. 

	With  to the materials, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got some budget to get fairy lights, batteries, translucent paper, colour paper and wrapping paper. Students will just need to bring cereal boxes, as well as washed and cleaned milk cartons. For the other materials, does the care centre provide? 

	After much discussions, we felt that groups of 2 or conducting online will not be ideal for hands-on craft. As such, we are hoping that the COVID-19 situation mild down by December so we can organise it in groups of 5. In the case the situation remains, we would like to check on how lessons are conducted currently so we could replicate similar SMM for our event.

	Lastly, we would be conducting 2 separate sessions for P3 and P4 students respectively, with each session being 2 hours long, on any date between 20-23 December 2024. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re hoping to have the event in a single day, with one session earlier in the day wle the other one will be afterwards. Do feel free to suggest a date and arrangement that suit the classes best. 

	Feel free to clarify any queries. Thank you!

	With Love,

	 Geraldine,

	Thank you for the information, we'll plan the events wle keeping those in mind. As we would need to get approval from our school first, we would need slightly more time before finalizing the details. Tentatively, we will send you the proposal by late September and stick to either of the dates 21-24 Dec for the event.

	Hope ts would give you sufficient time for arranging as well. Much thanks! 

	Really sorry for the delayed response. 

	Yours sincerely,

	 ,

	Thank you for looking into ts program! I've taken note of the tentative dates from 20-24 December 2021, we can finalise the date when more details are being firmed up.

	The P3 & P4 class size is 21 pax & 13 pax respectively. On our end, we are alright for the on-site engagement to still carry on with ts age group, though unvaccinated. 
	Thank you for giving us the assurance that your team will be fully vaccinated by then!

	Looking at the current cases & safe discing measures, it is good to have an online schle planned out like what your team initiated. 
	In view of that, may I please suggest that your team propose a cut-off date for us to make a decision on whether we should proceed with an on-site or online program regardless of future changes in the safe discing measures? Ts is to ensure that there is sufficient time for both parties adjust the program & getting the attendance of the cldren.

	The general safe discing measures that we have in our centre as of now a
	
	- No more than 5 pax per group for activities/discussion, including students & volunteer 
	- Classes of different levels are not allowed to mingle 
	- To try our best to maintain 1 metre disce between individuals & groups 

	As the detailed safe discing measures may change frequently, above are some basic general guidelines for us to follow. If there is anytng else to add on along the way, I will keep you updated. Hope ts clarifies!

	Please feel free to contact me if more clarification is needed! Thank you.

	 Geraldine,  

	 

	ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s some really great news! Looking forward to working with your team.  

	 

	After much discussion with my team, we are likely to organize the program on either of these dates, 20-24 December 2021, after our finals examination. In addition, we are looking into designing the program for P3 and/or P4 students. A query we have would be that is it possible to plan activities for ts age group, as t cannot be vaccinated? If possible, may we know the cohort size for P3 and P4 respectively? If itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not encouraged, would changing our target group to above 12 years old be more suitable? On our side, please rest assured that my team will be fully vaccinated by then.  

	 

	As much as we love to organize an on-site activity, we would plan an online schle as well in case of any sudden wave of infection (touchwood!). Is it possible to share with us some safe management measures that you observe so that we can include similar measures in the proposal?  

	 

	Thank you so much and hope to hear from you soon!  

	 

	Have a great day!

To Crystal,

 

Good afternoon, I am writing ts email to request if we can start our online event earlier. As the online padlet has been approved, our team would like to request if we can start it on Week 9 (8th November Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 26th November) instead on Week 10 as we feel like running the event for a longer period will be more impactful. Looking forward to your reply.

 Wei Xuan,

 

For the email draft, if you intend to send ts out before the physical wteboard section is cleared, you may want to indicate that ts is still TBC at ts point of time.

 

We do not have TVs for loan. The 2 weeksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ timeline includes the process of vetting of videos, editing (if any) and clearance for the use of campus TV wch involves multiple departments Ã¢â‚¬â€œ OSL, Marketing, OCIF and IT. The timeline is actually quite reasonable and if all clearance can be obtained earlier, I will definitely inform you on that.

 Requesting for an event approval for Week 11 

 

To Office of Student Life and Events,

 

Good afternoon, I am Cheng Wei Xuan from ROOT and I am writing ts email with  to requesting approval for my teamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s event. 

 

Our event (A Collage Network) aims to motivate students by allowing students to send motivational messages and images to each other. The event will be split into 2 parts, an online and a physical. For the online ponent, we will be allowing the entire school to send their encouragement here padlet/ROOT_Welfare3/t1f3ozzfypy278z2 <apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook/?url=%3A%2F%2Fpadlet%2FROOT_Welfare3%2Ft1f3ozzfypy278z2Students&data=04%7C01%7C_%40.sutd..%7Ca67603c70c774829396508d9a974ca49%7C3476b776e9904f72b95062489831623d%7C0%7C0%7C637727141355394367%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=oLBT4cjjcFPo1kr3TCb%2Bb%2Bt%2FdRY21kHMjuBUmCj1pMM%3D&reserved=0> .

 

Students can see each other messages through the same link. We intend to have the online munity board up from 15th November to 26th of November (Week 10 and 11).  At the end of the event on the 26th of November, my team intends to make a video collage of all the messages written and to display the video collage on the TV in the school canteen. We will only be able to send you the video on the 28th of November. Therefore, I would also like to check if there is an estimate on how long it would take before the video can be displayed on the tv as I undersd that the video needs to be approved first. We would like to display the collage video until the 17th of December (Week 14) when finals are over.

 

For the physical ponent, it will be targeted to the Term 1  students. We would like to paste wteboard sheets onto each Term 1 Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s classroom doors such that t can decorate and write motivational messages for each other for class bonding and to motivate the cohort. I have attached a layout of where we will be pasting the wteboard sheets in ts email. We would like to leave the wteboards from Week 11 till Week 14 until finals are over.

 

I've attached the Event Proposal Form as well as the Risk Assessment in ts email. If you have any further question you can always contact me. Thank you. 

 

Yours sincerely, 

Cheng Wei Xuan

We do not have TVs for loan.

 Requesting for an event approval for Week 11 

 

To Office of Student Life and Events,

 

Good afternoon, I am Cheng Wei Xuan from ROOT and I am writing ts email with  to requesting approval for my teamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s event. 

 

Our event (A Collage Network) aims to motivate students by allowing students to send motivational messages and images to each other. The event will be split into 2 parts, an online and a physical. For the online ponent, we will be allowing the entire school to send their encouragement here padlet/ROOT_Welfare3/t1f3ozzfypy278z2 <apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook/?url=%3A%2F%2Fpadlet%2FROOT_Welfare3%2Ft1f3ozzfypy278z2Students&data=04%7C01%7C_%40.sutd..%7Cf10db8d386a44d98054408d9a97234b0%7C3476b776e9904f72b95062489831623d%7C0%7C0%7C637727130430600217%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=7ELmNVYJUZ0usiX1WNl27HlEU3FUCnuOIInMo5689Hw%3D&reserved=0> .

 

Students can see each other messages through the same link. We intend to have the online munity board up from 15th November to 26th of November (Week 10 and 11).  At the end of the event on the 26th of November, my team intends to make a video collage of all the messages written and to display the video collage on the TV in the school canteen. We will only be able to send you the video on the 28th of November. Therefore, I would also like to check if there is an estimate on how long it would take before the video can be displayed on the tv as I undersd that the video needs to be approved first. We would like to display the collage video until the 17th of December (Week 14) when finals are over.

 

For the physical ponent, it will be targeted to the Term 1  students. We would like to paste wteboard sheets onto each Term 1 Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s classroom doors such that t can decorate and write motivational messages for each other for class bonding and to motivate the cohort. I have attached a layout of where we will be pasting the wteboard sheets in ts email. We would like to leave the wteboards from Week 11 till Week 14 until finals are over.

 

I've attached the Event Proposal Form as well as the Risk Assessment in ts email. If you have any further question you can always contact me. Thank you. 

 

Yours sincerely, 

Cheng Wei Xuan

 Crystal,

 

Yes, the decorating of srts will occur during their break and free time on their own will. The main part on ROOT will just be handling the srt sale. So, it's fine to take it as a srt sale activity. 

 

No venue booking is required as no distribution booth will be set. However, my team will need ROOT Cove access on the collection day to store, sort and give the srts to the class rep. How many days in advance do I need to provide the name list for access? 6 Dec on the EPF is tentative as I would need the approval of the event, to purchase the srt then can I confirm with the vendor with  to the collection.

 

Thank you so much! Have a great Tuesday Ã°Å¸â„¢â€š

 

Yours sincerely,

As we are unable to monitor the Ã¢â‚¬Å“eventÃ¢â‚¬Â since participants is given OTOT to get their friends to design their tsrts, I tnk I will review ts as sales of tsrt activity instead of an event. It seems that there will be no venue booking as well since there will be no distribution booth for the tsrt or specific venue for students to design the tsrt. Please let me know if ts is ok.

 Events and OSL,

 

To celebrate the end of  term, we would be having a decorating srt event for the Term 3 SUTDents in Week 13-14 (because we can't have BBQ sadly). Ts idea is inspired by the signing on uniforms on the last day of secondary school. However, as we do not have uniforms, we will be giving wte srts out at $2 each. As the cost for 400 t-srts is more than $1k, my team have sent out quotation requests to different panies and would include it when requesting the purchase.

 



 

If we can get approval by next week and proceed with the sign-up form and purchase in time, here would be the ine collection details.

 

Details of ine collection: 

Start date of collection: 26 November 2021

End date of collection: 29 November 2021

Submit Wallet User(s) details 

Full Name (as per NRIC): Devans Jos 

Email (SUTD): 1005162 <mail1005162>  

Mobile Number: 93821256

 

We will adhere to the current SMM:

*	There should be at least 1-metre disce between individuals, or if ts is not possible, at least 2m discing between groups of no more than 5 persons for mask-on general activities. 

*	Attendance of each activity will be submitted to staff advisor witn the next day.  

*	No food and drink are to be supplied or consumed witn the activity area to ensure masks remain on (apart from bottled water). 

 

After confirming the collection date for the srts, I would send the names of the people helping at ROOT Cove to collect the srts and distribute to the class reps.

 

Hope to get your approval. Feel free to contact me at 97705194 for any clarification. 

 

Yours sincerely,

  Student Helper for week 11

 

 Prof Franklin,

 

I've filled in the available timings. Data Driven World module cropped up a quiz that ends at 4.30pm on Monday. If there isn't anyone available for 4.30pm slot on Monday, I can e down after the test, just that I'll be slightly late. Though I didn't indicate previously in the form that I'm available on Thursday, if you will need people to fill up the first 2 slots, just let me know. I have no class during those timings. 

 

Can I check if there will be a briefing on how we can help and should be doing on that day?

 

Thank you! 

 

Yours sincerely,

As the Cabinet of the 9th SUTD Student Government and 5th SAC, it has been our mitment to listen to your concerns and feedback. We undersd that the Subject Enrolment Exercise process is a topic that many students are concerned about, that is why we started working with the Office of IT and Office of Student Admin (OSA) back from January 2021, up till now. 

There have since been 2 Subject Enrolment Exercises in May and Sept 2021 and through working with OIT, OSA and, also collecting students' feedback from surveys, we were glad that there has been much improvement to the Subject Enrolment Exercise experience. We would like to share a few key results from the 6th September Subject Enrolment Exercise Survey and, also the progress that we have made so far.

Our work is far from done. The Student Government are mitted to continuing our work with OIT and OSA to improve the Subject Enrolment Exercise. We will continue to collect feedback from students via surveys regarding the Subject Enrolment Exercise.

On that note, Dialogue with Senior Management (DSM) will be happening on 19th November (Friday), 3pm via YouTube Live Stream. Our DSM Planning Team will be sharing the DSM YouTube Live Steam Link shortly. Do join us in our Dialogue with Senior Management to share any other concerns that you have and listen in to various sharing and announcements by our SUTD Senior Management.

			We would like to check the following details:

			1. What is the accepted payment mode?

			2. How long is the lead time from confirming the design and number per size to collection? 

			3. Is delivery free?

			 

			Yours sincerely,

2021 September Term - 10.022 : Modelling Uncertainty: Modelling Uncertainty Week 11," students,

Here is the format for Modelling Uncertainty during Week 11:

- No new content will be introduced in Week 11. (Week 12 class 1 slides, wch may be relevant to the 2D project, will be released during Week 11.)

- There will only be 1 class in Week 11. That class will be unstructured, and the purpose of it is for you to ask your instructors any questions about the 2D.

- For F02, F03, F09, F10, that class will be the second class of the week. For everyone else, it will be the first class of the week.

In other words: for F01, F04, F05, F06, F08, F11: it will be the Tuesday class; for F07: the Wednesday class; for F02, F03, F09, F10: the Thursday class.

- I will upload some tips/guidelines about the 2D on eDimension over the weekend.

Best wishes,

James

 there,

It's easier to be productive when you're using the right tool for the job. Power tools can be useful for heavy-duty tasks, but sometimes all you need is a hammer.

That's why we're excited to introduce simple tables Ã¢â‚¬â€ a top feature request from the Notion munity! Use them when you need to organize information in your notes & docs, but don't need all the bells & wstles of a database.

In that case, could you assist to represent your current cohort class and re-indicate the t-srt sizes. 

You only need to indicate for 1 t-srt size per student in the below table. (1 = 1 set of 1 black & 1 maroon). We will try to match but it will be subjected to availability of sizes.

The ordered quantity is slightly different, we will try to match the previous t-srt sizes that you have given us and inform you on the collection after we pack finish.

The sizes are mostly S & L and a couple of XS & M. No more XL.

I will give according to the class who email in first until no more stock is left.

For the pasting of the wteboards, could you use blu tac (wte) instead of the original blue color so t will not be seen from inside the classroom wch could be unsightly. 

 

If you cannot find the wte tac, OCIF suggested to paste wte papers from inside the classroom instead to cover the blu tac. Do let us know your preferred arrangements or you may call me to clarify further. 

 

Hope to hear from you soon. Thank you.

Good afternoon, I am writing ts email to request if we can start our online event earlier. As the online padlet has been approved, our team would like to request if we can start it on Week 9 (8th November Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 26th November) instead on Week 10 as we feel like running the event for a longer period will be more impactful. Looking forward to your reply.

 Wei Xuan,

 

For the email draft, if you intend to send ts out before the physical wteboard section is cleared, you may want to indicate that ts is still TBC at ts point of time.

 

We do not have TVs for loan. The 2 weeksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ timeline includes the process of vetting of videos, editing (if any) and clearance for the use of campus TV wch involves multiple departments Ã¢â‚¬â€œ OSL, Marketing, OCIF and IT. The timeline is actually quite reasonable and if all clearance can be obtained earlier, I will definitely inform you on that.

 Requesting for an event approval for Week 11 

 

To Office of Student Life and Events,

 

Good afternoon, I am Cheng Wei Xuan from ROOT and I am writing ts email with  to requesting approval for my teamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s event. 

 

Our event (A Collage Network) aims to motivate students by allowing students to send motivational messages and images to each other. The event will be split into 2 parts, an online and a physical. For the online ponent, we will be allowing the entire school to send their encouragement here padlet/ROOT_Welfare3/t1f3ozzfypy278z2 <apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook/?url=%3A%2F%2Fpadlet%2FROOT_Welfare3%2Ft1f3ozzfypy278z2Students&data=04%7C01%7C_%40.sutd..%7Cf71d83c8dafc4a86bda808d9ad53413a%7C3476b776e9904f72b95062489831623d%7C0%7C0%7C637731395345065572%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=JWDP8b3%2BN6Tuh0ErlZjEmu4INEOprVbtvQEmTtSA5MU%3D&reserved=0> .

 

Students can see each other messages through the same link. We intend to have the online munity board up from 15th November to 26th of November (Week 10 and 11).  At the end of the event on the 26th of November, my team intends to make a video collage of all the messages written and to display the video collage on the TV in the school canteen. We will only be able to send you the video on the 28th of November. Therefore, I would also like to check if there is an estimate on how long it would take before the video can be displayed on the tv as I undersd that the video needs to be approved first. We would like to display the collage video until the 17th of December (Week 14) when finals are over.

 

For the physical ponent, it will be targeted to the Term 1  students. We would like to paste wteboard sheets onto each Term 1 Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s classroom doors such that t can decorate and write motivational messages for each other for class bonding and to motivate the cohort. I have attached a layout of where we will be pasting the wteboard sheets in ts email. We would like to leave the wteboards from Week 11 till Week 14 until finals are over.

 

I've attached the Event Proposal Form as well as the Risk Assessment in ts email. If you have any further question you can always contact me. Thank you. 

 

Yours sincerely, 

Cheng Wei Xuan

 Enquiry of Modelling Uncertainty 2D ponent

 

 Prof James,

 

I am , a term 3 student, writing in to enquire about the 2D Project.

 

I would like to check on what does an interactive Excel file mean? Given that if we use Toolpak, it will generate the table in a new sheet, it would be difficult to make that interactive. Is there any specific ponent that needs to be interactive or any specific test you would be running to test the interactivity? Secondly, can I confirm that we don't have to do splitting of data(into training & test sets) for task1.

 

Thank you!

For the pasting of the wteboards, could you use blu tac (wte) instead of the original blue color so t will not be seen from inside the classroom wch could be unsightly. 

 

If you cannot find the wte tac, OCIF suggested to paste wte papers from inside the classroom instead to cover the blu tac. Do let us know your preferred arrangements or you may call me to clarify further. 

 

Hope to hear from you soon. Thank you.

Good afternoon, I am writing ts email to request if we can start our online event earlier. As the online padlet has been approved, our team would like to request if we can start it on Week 9 (8th November Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 26th November) instead on Week 10 as we feel like running the event for a longer period will be more impactful. Looking forward to your reply.

 Wei Xuan,

 

For the email draft, if you intend to send ts out before the physical wteboard section is cleared, you may want to indicate that ts is still TBC at ts point of time.

 

We do not have TVs for loan. The 2 weeksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ timeline includes the process of vetting of videos, editing (if any) and clearance for the use of campus TV wch involves multiple departments Ã¢â‚¬â€œ OSL, Marketing, OCIF and IT. The timeline is actually quite reasonable and if all clearance can be obtained earlier, I will definitely inform you on that.

 Requesting for an event approval for Week 11 

 

To Office of Student Life and Events,

 

Good afternoon, I am Cheng Wei Xuan from ROOT and I am writing ts email with  to requesting approval for my teamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s event. 

 

Our event (A Collage Network) aims to motivate students by allowing students to send motivational messages and images to each other. The event will be split into 2 parts, an online and a physical. For the online ponent, we will be allowing the entire school to send their encouragement here padlet/ROOT_Welfare3/t1f3ozzfypy278z2 <apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook/?url=%3A%2F%2Fpadlet%2FROOT_Welfare3%2Ft1f3ozzfypy278z2Students&data=04%7C01%7C_%40.sutd..%7C5c88b64bf83e4534aa2908d9adc933c0%7C3476b776e9904f72b95062489831623d%7C0%7C0%7C637731901945666740%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=V8rdSy2hnWV4%2FXEjLmsxW%2Fm0uPVZrZqyKdQEUfukw%3D&reserved=0> .

 

Students can see each other messages through the same link. We intend to have the online munity board up from 15th November to 26th of November (Week 10 and 11).  At the end of the event on the 26th of November, my team intends to make a video collage of all the messages written and to display the video collage on the TV in the school canteen. We will only be able to send you the video on the 28th of November. Therefore, I would also like to check if there is an estimate on how long it would take before the video can be displayed on the tv as I undersd that the video needs to be approved first. We would like to display the collage video until the 17th of December (Week 14) when finals are over.

 

For the physical ponent, it will be targeted to the Term 1  students. We would like to paste wteboard sheets onto each Term 1 Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s classroom doors such that t can decorate and write motivational messages for each other for class bonding and to motivate the cohort. I have attached a layout of where we will be pasting the wteboard sheets in ts email. We would like to leave the wteboards from Week 11 till Week 14 until finals are over.

 

I've attached the Event Proposal Form as well as the Risk Assessment in ts email. If you have any further question you can always contact me. Thank you. 

 

Yours sincerely, 

Cheng Wei Xuan

 Crystal,

 

Sorry for the unclear message. So, we will be proceeding with the t-srt purchase and give it out to the whole cohort for free with the Class of 2024 measurements. Ts is because we wish to make the event inclusive for all and not want anyone to feel left out because of the $2 fee.

 

To pensate for that, we wish to do a charity for Christmas as a batch. So, instead of pang $2 for the srts, we will share a donation link to the Class of 2024 as a token from out batch to the society ts festive season. Ts will be optional for all, with no restriction to donation amount and out of goodwill only. 

 

Hope ts clarifies.

 

Yours sincerely,

 Crystal,

 

Yes, the decorating of srts will occur during their break and free time on their own will. The main part on ROOT will just be handling the srt sale. So, it's fine to take it as a srt sale activity. 

 

No venue booking is required as no distribution booth will be set. However, my team will need ROOT Cove access on the collection day to store, sort and give the srts to the class rep. How many days in advance do I need to provide the name list for access? 6 Dec on the EPF is tentative as I would need the approval of the event, to purchase the srt then can I confirm with the vendor with  to the collection.

 

Thank you so much! Have a great Tuesday Ã°Å¸â„¢â€š

 

Yours sincerely,

As we are unable to monitor the Ã¢â‚¬Å“eventÃ¢â‚¬Â since participants is given OTOT to get their friends to design their tsrts, I tnk I will review ts as sales of tsrt activity instead of an event. It seems that there will be no venue booking as well since there will be no distribution booth for the tsrt or specific venue for students to design the tsrt. Please let me know if ts is ok.

 Events and OSL,

 

To celebrate the end of  term, we would be having a decorating srt event for the Term 3 SUTDents in Week 13-14 (because we can't have BBQ sadly). Ts idea is inspired by the signing on uniforms on the last day of secondary school. However, as we do not have uniforms, we will be giving wte srts out at $2 each. As the cost for 400 t-srts is more than $1k, my team have sent out quotation requests to different panies and would include it when requesting the purchase.

 



 

If we can get approval by next week and proceed with the sign-up form and purchase in time, here would be the ine collection details.

 

Details of ine collection: 

Start date of collection: 26 November 2021

End date of collection: 29 November 2021

Submit Wallet User(s) details 

Full Name (as per NRIC): Devans Jos 

Email (SUTD): 1005162 <mail1005162>  

Mobile Number: 93821256

 

We will adhere to the current SMM:

*	There should be at least 1-metre disce between individuals, or if ts is not possible, at least 2m discing between groups of no more than 5 persons for mask-on general activities. 

*	Attendance of each activity will be submitted to staff advisor witn the next day.  

*	No food and drink are to be supplied or consumed witn the activity area to ensure masks remain on (apart from bottled water). 

 

After confirming the collection date for the srts, I would send the names of the people helping at ROOT Cove to collect the srts and distribute to the class reps.

 

Hope to get your approval. Feel free to contact me at 97705194 for any clarification. 

 

Yours sincerely,

 EPF: Freshnomore Event

 

 Events and OSL,

 

To celebrate the end of  term, we would be having a decorating srt event for the Term 3 SUTDents in Week 13-14 (because we can't have BBQ sadly). Ts idea is inspired by the signing on uniforms on the last day of secondary school. However, as we do not have uniforms, we will be giving wte srts out at $2 each. As the cost for 400 t-srts is more than $1k, my team have sent out quotation requests to different panies and would include it when requesting the purchase.

 



 

If we can get approval by next week and proceed with the sign-up form and purchase in time, here would be the ine collection details.

 

Details of ine collection: 

Start date of collection: 26 November 2021

End date of collection: 29 November 2021

Submit Wallet User(s) details 

Full Name (as per NRIC): Devans Jos 

Email (SUTD): 1005162 <mail1005162>  

Mobile Number: 93821256

 

We will adhere to the current SMM:

*	There should be at least 1-metre disce between individuals, or if ts is not possible, at least 2m discing between groups of no more than 5 persons for mask-on general activities. 

*	Attendance of each activity will be submitted to staff advisor witn the next day.  

*	No food and drink are to be supplied or consumed witn the activity area to ensure masks remain on (apart from bottled water). 

 

After confirming the collection date for the srts, I would send the names of the people helping at ROOT Cove to collect the srts and distribute to the class reps.

 

Hope to get your approval. Feel free to contact me at 97705194 for any clarification. 

 

Yours sincerely,

Can I confirm that the adhesive tape colored or clear type? 

 

OCIF does not allow using colored adhesive tape as ts can be seen from inside the classroom glass doors. Thanks!

For the pasting of the wteboards, could you use blu tac (wte) instead of the original blue color so t will not be seen from inside the classroom wch could be unsightly. 

 

If you cannot find the wte tac, OCIF suggested to paste wte papers from inside the classroom instead to cover the blu tac. Do let us know your preferred arrangements or you may call me to clarify further. 

 

Hope to hear from you soon. Thank you.

To Crystal,

 

Good afternoon, I am writing ts email to request if we can start our online event earlier. As the online padlet has been approved, our team would like to request if we can start it on Week 9 (8th November Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 26th November) instead on Week 10 as we feel like running the event for a longer period will be more impactful. Looking forward to your reply.

 Wei Xuan,

 

For the email draft, if you intend to send ts out before the physical wteboard section is cleared, you may want to indicate that ts is still TBC at ts point of time.

 

We do not have TVs for loan. The 2 weeksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ timeline includes the process of vetting of videos, editing (if any) and clearance for the use of campus TV wch involves multiple departments Ã¢â‚¬â€œ OSL, Marketing, OCIF and IT. The timeline is actually quite reasonable and if all clearance can be obtained earlier, I will definitely inform you on that.

 Requesting for an event approval for Week 11 

 

To Office of Student Life and Events,

 

Good afternoon, I am Cheng Wei Xuan from ROOT and I am writing ts email with  to requesting approval for my teamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s event. 

 

Our event (A Collage Network) aims to motivate students by allowing students to send motivational messages and images to each other. The event will be split into 2 parts, an online and a physical. For the online ponent, we will be allowing the entire school to send their encouragement here padlet/ROOT_Welfare3/t1f3ozzfypy278z2 <apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook/?url=%3A%2F%2Fpadlet%2FROOT_Welfare3%2Ft1f3ozzfypy278z2Students&data=04%7C01%7C_%40.sutd..%7C6db0840d08a34625e19e08d9ad9c871b%7C3476b776e9904f72b95062489831623d%7C0%7C0%7C637731710064730572%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=iW5gTBde%2FScKFyj41YEfTSimycI3qpRFl2zpYxmmQM0%3D&reserved=0> .

 

Students can see each other messages through the same link. We intend to have the online munity board up from 15th November to 26th of November (Week 10 and 11).  At the end of the event on the 26th of November, my team intends to make a video collage of all the messages written and to display the video collage on the TV in the school canteen. We will only be able to send you the video on the 28th of November. Therefore, I would also like to check if there is an estimate on how long it would take before the video can be displayed on the tv as I undersd that the video needs to be approved first. We would like to display the collage video until the 17th of December (Week 14) when finals are over.

 

For the physical ponent, it will be targeted to the Term 1  students. We would like to paste wteboard sheets onto each Term 1 Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s classroom doors such that t can decorate and write motivational messages for each other for class bonding and to motivate the cohort. I have attached a layout of where we will be pasting the wteboard sheets in ts email. We would like to leave the wteboards from Week 11 till Week 14 until finals are over.

 

I've attached the Event Proposal Form as well as the Risk Assessment in ts email. If you have any further question you can always contact me. Thank you. 

 

Yours sincerely, 

Cheng Wei Xuan

Good afternoon, I am writing ts email to request if we can start our online event earlier. As the online padlet has been approved, our team would like to request if we can start it on Week 9 (8th November Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 26th November) instead on Week 10 as we feel like running the event for a longer period will be more impactful. Looking forward to your reply.

 Wei Xuan,

 

For the email draft, if you intend to send ts out before the physical wteboard section is cleared, you may want to indicate that ts is still TBC at ts point of time.

 

We do not have TVs for loan. The 2 weeksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ timeline includes the process of vetting of videos, editing (if any) and clearance for the use of campus TV wch involves multiple departments Ã¢â‚¬â€œ OSL, Marketing, OCIF and IT. The timeline is actually quite reasonable and if all clearance can be obtained earlier, I will definitely inform you on that.

 Requesting for an event approval for Week 11 

 

To Office of Student Life and Events,

 

Good afternoon, I am Cheng Wei Xuan from ROOT and I am writing ts email with  to requesting approval for my teamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s event. 

 

Our event (A Collage Network) aims to motivate students by allowing students to send motivational messages and images to each other. The event will be split into 2 parts, an online and a physical. For the online ponent, we will be allowing the entire school to send their encouragement here padlet/ROOT_Welfare3/t1f3ozzfypy278z2 <apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook/?url=%3A%2F%2Fpadlet%2FROOT_Welfare3%2Ft1f3ozzfypy278z2Students&data=04%7C01%7C_%40.sutd..%7C86d765932f144537f30208d9ad9a340d%7C3476b776e9904f72b95062489831623d%7C0%7C0%7C637731700087034728%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=8zov0yEhVKIRE0jW8dTzY6rBNKNFXEYOqk7oQFM9%2BYQ%3D&reserved=0> .

 

Students can see each other messages through the same link. We intend to have the online munity board up from 15th November to 26th of November (Week 10 and 11).  At the end of the event on the 26th of November, my team intends to make a video collage of all the messages written and to display the video collage on the TV in the school canteen. We will only be able to send you the video on the 28th of November. Therefore, I would also like to check if there is an estimate on how long it would take before the video can be displayed on the tv as I undersd that the video needs to be approved first. We would like to display the collage video until the 17th of December (Week 14) when finals are over.

 

For the physical ponent, it will be targeted to the Term 1  students. We would like to paste wteboard sheets onto each Term 1 Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s classroom doors such that t can decorate and write motivational messages for each other for class bonding and to motivate the cohort. I have attached a layout of where we will be pasting the wteboard sheets in ts email. We would like to leave the wteboards from Week 11 till Week 14 until finals are over.

 

I've attached the Event Proposal Form as well as the Risk Assessment in ts email. If you have any further question you can always contact me. Thank you. 

 

Yours sincerely, 

Cheng Wei Xuan

 Crystal,

 

Sorry for the unclear message. So, we will be proceeding with the t-srt purchase and give it out to the whole cohort for free with the Class of 2024 measurements. Ts is because we wish to make the event inclusive for all and not want anyone to feel left out because of the $2 fee.

 

To pensate for that, we wish to do a charity for Christmas as a batch. So, instead of pang $2 for the srts, we will share a donation link to the Class of 2024 as a token from out batch to the society ts festive season. Ts will be optional for all, with no restriction to donation amount and out of goodwill only. 

 

Hope ts clarifies.

 

Yours sincerely,

 Crystal,

 

Yes, the decorating of srts will occur during their break and free time on their own will. The main part on ROOT will just be handling the srt sale. So, it's fine to take it as a srt sale activity. 

 

No venue booking is required as no distribution booth will be set. However, my team will need ROOT Cove access on the collection day to store, sort and give the srts to the class rep. How many days in advance do I need to provide the name list for access? 6 Dec on the EPF is tentative as I would need the approval of the event, to purchase the srt then can I confirm with the vendor with  to the collection.

 

Thank you so much! Have a great Tuesday Ã°Å¸â„¢â€š

 

Yours sincerely,

As we are unable to monitor the Ã¢â‚¬Å“eventÃ¢â‚¬Â since participants is given OTOT to get their friends to design their tsrts, I tnk I will review ts as sales of tsrt activity instead of an event. It seems that there will be no venue booking as well since there will be no distribution booth for the tsrt or specific venue for students to design the tsrt. Please let me know if ts is ok.

 EPF: Freshnomore Event

 

 Events and OSL,

 

To celebrate the end of  term, we would be having a decorating srt event for the Term 3 SUTDents in Week 13-14 (because we can't have BBQ sadly). Ts idea is inspired by the signing on uniforms on the last day of secondary school. However, as we do not have uniforms, we will be giving wte srts out at $2 each. As the cost for 400 t-srts is more than $1k, my team have sent out quotation requests to different panies and would include it when requesting the purchase.

 



 

If we can get approval by next week and proceed with the sign-up form and purchase in time, here would be the ine collection details.

 

Details of ine collection: 

Start date of collection: 26 November 2021

End date of collection: 29 November 2021

Submit Wallet User(s) details 

Full Name (as per NRIC): Devans Jos 

Email (SUTD): 1005162 <mail1005162>  

Mobile Number: 93821256

 

We will adhere to the current SMM:

*	There should be at least 1-metre disce between individuals, or if ts is not possible, at least 2m discing between groups of no more than 5 persons for mask-on general activities. 

*	Attendance of each activity will be submitted to staff advisor witn the next day.  

*	No food and drink are to be supplied or consumed witn the activity area to ensure masks remain on (apart from bottled water). 

 

After confirming the collection date for the srts, I would send the names of the people helping at ROOT Cove to collect the srts and distribute to the class reps.

 

Hope to get your approval. Feel free to contact me at 97705194 for any clarification. 

 

Yours sincerely,

 Enquiry on a collaboration

 

 Anthony,

 

I am  from Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) Student Government (ROOT). As Christmas approaches, we would like to organise a fundraising event in December to give back to the society. I came across the Cldren-At-Risk Empowerment Association (CARE Singapore) page on giving. and would like to ask if a collaboration is possible. 

 

One of our school clubs has done similar collaboration with NKF by setting up a giving. exclusively for SUTD students. Here's the link <apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook/?url=%3A%2F%2Fwww.giving.%2Fcampaigns%2Fsutdrotaract-project-renal&data=04%7C01%7C_%40.sutd..%7C4615cc8d31d04bd3fb4608d9af21f4f0%7C3476b776e9904f72b95062489831623d%7C0%7C0%7C637733385770188673%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0&sdata=gvSoOLZo7WbnYJJcfRJOk3374S8mZeBjqFkzadSJ8z0%3D&reserved=0>  for a reference. If you're keen for a collaboration, is it possible if you could set a project and share the link with us? We would tnk that $5, $10, $15, $20, and $50 would be affordable range for students.

 

Feel free to call me at 97705194 for more discussion. Hope to hear from you soon.

 

Thank you!

 

Yours sincerely,

Thank you for writing in to us. Here is some brief background information about CldrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Wisng Well (CWW):

 

We are a registered charity founded in 2002, and the only charity organisation in Singapore focused on the holistic cation of cldren and youth from disadvantaged backgrounds. Our cldren e from low-ine families, and their parents may be ill, incarcerated, or absent from their lives. We provide a broad range of services to them 100% free-of-charge. Our programmes support their current cational and daily living needs, as well as equip them with skills for their future, so as to empower them to escape the poverty trap. An introduction to CWW is attached for your reference. Just to clarify, we are not an orphanage. Hope that ts is still in alignment with you.

 

We would love to collaborate on a fundraising initiative, thanks for keeping us in mindÃ°Å¸ËœÅ  Yes sure, I can help to set up the campaign. Would you like to let us know what content you prefer; including the goal and campaign period?

 Sir/Madam, 

 

I am  from Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) Student Government (ROOT). As Christmas approaches, we would like to organise a fundraising event in December to give back to the society. I came across the Cldren's Wisng Well page on giving. and would like to ask if a collaboration is possible. 

 

One of our school clubs has done similar collaboration with NKF by setting up a giving. exclusively for SUTD students. Here's the link <apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook/?url=%3A%2F%2Fwww.giving.%2Fcampaigns%2Fsutdrotaract-project-renal&data=04%7C01%7C_%40.sutd..%7C6d7824444128409cd7a308d9af181e29%7C3476b776e9904f72b95062489831623d%7C0%7C0%7C637733341571274662%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0&sdata=03LUmB2v5Arphgo1RvHdXZfnYN1gr0oc094ArpO5Y%3D&reserved=0>  for a reference. If you're keen for a collaboration, is it possible if you could set a campaign and share the link with us? We would tnk that $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100 would be affordable range for students.

 

Feel free to call me at 97705194 for more discussion. Hope to hear from you soon.

 

Thank you!

 

Yours sincerely,

Btw, we are working on a intro to STEM project next year and have secured donations of quite a number of M-bots (www.makeblock/mbot-3 <apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook/?url=%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeblock%2Fmbot-3&data=04%7C01%7C_%40.sutd..%7Cc90aeb1fd1064178acd208d9af11eb70%7C3476b776e9904f72b95062489831623d%7C0%7C0%7C637733314856798780%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0&sdata=T0XbYUElOAieHf8WJboak7CRIP2XjC7k7vlmBQnz6w4%3D&reserved=0> )

 

Would you know if some groups in SUTD or your own group be keen to consider being volunteer Ã¢â‚¬Å“coachesÃ¢â‚¬Â with us when our programme is ready next year? Sussing out interest first since we are connected.

 Crystal,

 

Here's the updated EPF. I've edited the finance segment and some details of how it will be held. As we will just be giving out the srts, no sign up form will be needed. We will get the srt size from the class chairpersons. 

 

For the donation part, I contacted CARE but didn't receive any reply so I am in contact with Cldren's Wisng Well <apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook/?url=%3A%2F%2Fwww.wisngwell.org.%2Fabout-us%2F%23whoweare&data=04%7C01%7C_%40.sutd..%7Cf519bce0f8e1491e844608d9af3a7b91%7C3476b776e9904f72b95062489831623d%7C0%7C0%7C637733487998794539%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=MKa88dzmjKtO%2BcYUAmPse5LUuUcfZd%2BnFvtoXmoi6CQ%3D&reserved=0>  now.  T would take 1-2 working day to get back to me.

 

Thank you for the approval for SPROOT! Would like to check if the approval of Freshnomore event would e soon because there is a lead time of 1-2 weeks for the srt. Thank you!

 

Yours sincerely,

 Crystal,

 

Sorry for the unclear message. So, we will be proceeding with the t-srt purchase and give it out to the whole cohort for free with the Class of 2024 measurements. Ts is because we wish to make the event inclusive for all and not want anyone to feel left out because of the $2 fee.

 

To pensate for that, we wish to do a charity for Christmas as a batch. So, instead of pang $2 for the srts, we will share a donation link to the Class of 2024 as a token from out batch to the society ts festive season. Ts will be optional for all, with no restriction to donation amount and out of goodwill only. 

 

Hope ts clarifies.

 

Yours sincerely,

 Crystal,

 

Sure, I will inform Arshad closer to the date. 

 

An update on the project is that we would be scrapping the collection of ine plan and instead do a batch donation instead. Like Rotaract's NKF Donation, we will lias with an organisation to get a giving. link for our batch to donate as a batch charity. Do update me on how we can make ts possible. Feel free to drop me a call at 97705194 for any discussions.

 

Any update on the approval for both SPROOT and Freshnomore Event? We would like to purchase the items as soon as possible. Thank you! 

 

Yours sincerely,

 Crystal,

 

Yes, the decorating of srts will occur during their break and free time on their own will. The main part on ROOT will just be handling the srt sale. So, it's fine to take it as a srt sale activity. 

 

No venue booking is required as no distribution booth will be set. However, my team will need ROOT Cove access on the collection day to store, sort and give the srts to the class rep. How many days in advance do I need to provide the name list for access? 6 Dec on the EPF is tentative as I would need the approval of the event, to purchase the srt then can I confirm with the vendor with  to the collection.

 

Thank you so much! Have a great Tuesday Ã°Å¸â„¢â€š

 

Yours sincerely,

As we are unable to monitor the Ã¢â‚¬Å“eventÃ¢â‚¬Â since participants is given OTOT to get their friends to design their tsrts, I tnk I will review ts as sales of tsrt activity instead of an event. It seems that there will be no venue booking as well since there will be no distribution booth for the tsrt or specific venue for students to design the tsrt. Please let me know if ts is ok.

 Events and OSL,

 

To celebrate the end of  term, we would be having a decorating srt event for the Term 3 SUTDents in Week 13-14 (because we can't have BBQ sadly). Ts idea is inspired by the signing on uniforms on the last day of secondary school. However, as we do not have uniforms, we will be giving wte srts out at $2 each. As the cost for 400 t-srts is more than $1k, my team have sent out quotation requests to different panies and would include it when requesting the purchase.

 



 

If we can get approval by next week and proceed with the sign-up form and purchase in time, here would be the ine collection details.

 

Details of ine collection: 

Start date of collection: 26 November 2021

End date of collection: 29 November 2021

Submit Wallet User(s) details 

Full Name (as per NRIC): Devans Jos 

Email (SUTD): 1005162 <mail1005162>  

Mobile Number: 93821256

 

We will adhere to the current SMM:

*	There should be at least 1-metre disce between individuals, or if ts is not possible, at least 2m discing between groups of no more than 5 persons for mask-on general activities. 

*	Attendance of each activity will be submitted to staff advisor witn the next day.  

*	No food and drink are to be supplied or consumed witn the activity area to ensure masks remain on (apart from bottled water). 

 

After confirming the collection date for the srts, I would send the names of the people helping at ROOT Cove to collect the srts and distribute to the class reps.

 

Hope to get your approval. Feel free to contact me at 97705194 for any clarification. 

 

Yours sincerely,

 Sir/Madam, 

 

I am Devans from the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) Student Government. My team would like to seek your kind quotation for our event. 

 

We are looking for a simple wte cotton round neck, short sleeve srt with a simple (8cm * 8cm) logo printing in black ink on the sleeve or the front. As we are currently unsure on the potential numbers, we would like to seek 2 separate quotations, 1 for Qty: 300, 1 for Qty: 400. 

 

We would like to check the following details:

1. What is the accepted payment mode?

2. How long is the lead time from confirming the design and number per size to collection? 

3. Is delivery free?

 

Yours sincerely,

 

Devans Jos

 Enquiry on Term 3 Fund

 

 Bee Foong,

 

Previously, you shared with me that Term 3 will have class fund but we didn't receive any official notification or how to do so.

 

Can I clarify on how can we claim the $250 and do we need to seek approval from anyone?

 

Yours sincerely,

 Sir/Madam, 

 

I am  from Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) Student Government (ROOT). As Christmas approaches, we would like to organise a fundraising event in December to give back to the society. I came across the Cldren's Wisng Well page on giving. and would like to ask if a collaboration is possible. 

 

One of our school clubs has done similar collaboration with NKF by setting up a giving. exclusively for SUTD students. Here's the link <apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook/?url=%3A%2F%2Fwww.giving.%2Fcampaigns%2Fsutdrotaract-project-renal&data=04%7C01%7C_%40.sutd..%7C50b6af2a7a6a42c5cd3908d9b08b1b23%7C3476b776e9904f72b95062489831623d%7C0%7C0%7C637734934681497845%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0&sdata=zdvBJN1aLK9zD%2BUCXMRhEtFtZE1D5hWPmWtpwotKRYo%3D&reserved=0>  for a reference. If you're keen for a collaboration, is it possible if you could set a campaign and share the link with us? We would tnk that $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100 would be affordable range for students.

 

Feel free to call me at 97705194 for more discussion. Hope to hear from you soon.

 

Thank you!

Thank you for writing in to us. Here is some brief background information about CldrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Wisng Well (CWW):

 

We are a registered charity founded in 2002, and the only charity organisation in Singapore focused on the holistic cation of cldren and youth from disadvantaged backgrounds. Our cldren e from low-ine families, and their parents may be ill, incarcerated, or absent from their lives. We provide a broad range of services to them 100% free-of-charge. Our programmes support their current cational and daily living needs, as well as equip them with skills for their future, so as to empower them to escape the poverty trap. An introduction to CWW is attached for your reference. Just to clarify, we are not an orphanage. Hope that ts is still in alignment with you.

 

We would love to collaborate on a fundraising initiative, thanks for keeping us in mindÃ°Å¸ËœÅ  Yes sure, I can help to set up the campaign. Would you like to let us know what content you prefer; including the goal and campaign period?

 Sir/Madam, 

 

I am  from Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) Student Government (ROOT). As Christmas approaches, we would like to organise a fundraising event in December to give back to the society. I came across the Cldren's Wisng Well page on giving. and would like to ask if a collaboration is possible. 

 

One of our school clubs has done similar collaboration with NKF by setting up a giving. exclusively for SUTD students. Here's the link <apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook/?url=%3A%2F%2Fwww.giving.%2Fcampaigns%2Fsutdrotaract-project-renal&data=04%7C01%7C_%40.sutd..%7Cb83eff3ac8914adebd9e08d9b08db98f%7C3476b776e9904f72b95062489831623d%7C0%7C0%7C637734945348987896%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0&sdata=X5GmGFQLSwglIi0mQe3gFKbrk3XqRJ6B12ZiU4fD438%3D&reserved=0>  for a reference. If you're keen for a collaboration, is it possible if you could set a campaign and share the link with us? We would tnk that $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100 would be affordable range for students.

 

Feel free to call me at 97705194 for more discussion. Hope to hear from you soon.

 

Thank you!

 

Yours sincerely,

 Submission of 2D,"Alright thanks! If it's still not past the deadline, probably should take note of the following:

*	5 pages doesn't include the cover page, so you can still include 1 more page worth of stuff
*	probably shouldn't report all the significant figures, but always to 3sf unless more accuracy is useful (as in lack of sf will give some difference)

 Request for Quotation 

 

 Sir/Madam, 

 

I am Devans from the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) Student Government. My team would like to seek your kind quotation for our event. 

 

We are looking for a simple wte cotton round neck, short sleeve srt with a simple (8cm * 8cm) logo printing in black ink on the sleeve or the front. As we are currently unsure on the potential numbers, we would like to seek 2 separate quotations, 1 for Qty: 300, 1 for Qty: 400. 

 

We would like to check the following details:

1. What is the accepted payment mode?

2. How long is the lead time from confirming the design and number per size to collection? 

3. Is delivery free?

 

Yours sincerely,

 

Devans Jos

For the pasting of the wteboards, could you use blu tac (wte) instead of the original blue color so t will not be seen from inside the classroom wch could be unsightly. 

 

If you cannot find the wte tac, OCIF suggested to paste wte papers from inside the classroom instead to cover the blu tac. Do let us know your preferred arrangements or you may call me to clarify further. 

 

Hope to hear from you soon. Thank you.

To Crystal,

 

Good afternoon, I am writing ts email to request if we can start our online event earlier. As the online padlet has been approved, our team would like to request if we can start it on Week 9 (8th November Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 26th November) instead on Week 10 as we feel like running the event for a longer period will be more impactful. Looking forward to your reply.

 Wei Xuan,

 

For the email draft, if you intend to send ts out before the physical wteboard section is cleared, you may want to indicate that ts is still TBC at ts point of time.

 

We do not have TVs for loan. The 2 weeksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ timeline includes the process of vetting of videos, editing (if any) and clearance for the use of campus TV wch involves multiple departments Ã¢â‚¬â€œ OSL, Marketing, OCIF and IT. The timeline is actually quite reasonable and if all clearance can be obtained earlier, I will definitely inform you on that.

 Requesting for an event approval for Week 11 

 

To Office of Student Life and Events,

 

Good afternoon, I am Cheng Wei Xuan from ROOT and I am writing ts email with  to requesting approval for my teamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s event. 

 

Our event (A Collage Network) aims to motivate students by allowing students to send motivational messages and images to each other. The event will be split into 2 parts, an online and a physical. For the online ponent, we will be allowing the entire school to send their encouragement here padlet/ROOT_Welfare3/t1f3ozzfypy278z2 <apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook/?url=%3A%2F%2Fpadlet%2FROOT_Welfare3%2Ft1f3ozzfypy278z2Students&data=04%7C01%7C_%40.sutd..%7C22f53cb7f6b64592a6e608d9b158d9d3%7C3476b776e9904f72b95062489831623d%7C0%7C0%7C637735817944147511%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=8onkCav7%2BmCXz5F3VUcbm4NR9rouFtht6EcapFsFKXk%3D&reserved=0> .

 

Students can see each other messages through the same link. We intend to have the online munity board up from 15th November to 26th of November (Week 10 and 11).  At the end of the event on the 26th of November, my team intends to make a video collage of all the messages written and to display the video collage on the TV in the school canteen. We will only be able to send you the video on the 28th of November. Therefore, I would also like to check if there is an estimate on how long it would take before the video can be displayed on the tv as I undersd that the video needs to be approved first. We would like to display the collage video until the 17th of December (Week 14) when finals are over.

 

For the physical ponent, it will be targeted to the Term 1  students. We would like to paste wteboard sheets onto each Term 1 Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s classroom doors such that t can decorate and write motivational messages for each other for class bonding and to motivate the cohort. I have attached a layout of where we will be pasting the wteboard sheets in ts email. We would like to leave the wteboards from Week 11 till Week 14 until finals are over.

 

I've attached the Event Proposal Form as well as the Risk Assessment in ts email. If you have any further question you can always contact me. Thank you. 

 

Yours sincerely, 

Cheng Wei Xuan

To Crystal,

 

Good afternoon, I am writing ts email to request if we can start our online event earlier. As the online padlet has been approved, our team would like to request if we can start it on Week 9 (8th November Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 26th November) instead on Week 10 as we feel like running the event for a longer period will be more impactful. Looking forward to your reply.

 Wei Xuan,

 

For the email draft, if you intend to send ts out before the physical wteboard section is cleared, you may want to indicate that ts is still TBC at ts point of time.

 

We do not have TVs for loan. The 2 weeksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ timeline includes the process of vetting of videos, editing (if any) and clearance for the use of campus TV wch involves multiple departments Ã¢â‚¬â€œ OSL, Marketing, OCIF and IT. The timeline is actually quite reasonable and if all clearance can be obtained earlier, I will definitely inform you on that.

 Requesting for an event approval for Week 11 

 

To Office of Student Life and Events,

 

Good afternoon, I am Cheng Wei Xuan from ROOT and I am writing ts email with  to requesting approval for my teamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s event. 

 

Our event (A Collage Network) aims to motivate students by allowing students to send motivational messages and images to each other. The event will be split into 2 parts, an online and a physical. For the online ponent, we will be allowing the entire school to send their encouragement here padlet/ROOT_Welfare3/t1f3ozzfypy278z2 <apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook/?url=%3A%2F%2Fpadlet%2FROOT_Welfare3%2Ft1f3ozzfypy278z2Students&data=04%7C01%7C_%40.sutd..%7C2a8f126a64d447651df308d9b152d7c0%7C3476b776e9904f72b95062489831623d%7C0%7C0%7C637735791806795427%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=jFHNP%2FqLbTF8thOqCb13k3Lia8PtuoVubxIwtnR1p5E%3D&reserved=0> .

 

Students can see each other messages through the same link. We intend to have the online munity board up from 15th November to 26th of November (Week 10 and 11).  At the end of the event on the 26th of November, my team intends to make a video collage of all the messages written and to display the video collage on the TV in the school canteen. We will only be able to send you the video on the 28th of November. Therefore, I would also like to check if there is an estimate on how long it would take before the video can be displayed on the tv as I undersd that the video needs to be approved first. We would like to display the collage video until the 17th of December (Week 14) when finals are over.

 

For the physical ponent, it will be targeted to the Term 1  students. We would like to paste wteboard sheets onto each Term 1 Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s classroom doors such that t can decorate and write motivational messages for each other for class bonding and to motivate the cohort. I have attached a layout of where we will be pasting the wteboard sheets in ts email. We would like to leave the wteboards from Week 11 till Week 14 until finals are over.

 

I've attached the Event Proposal Form as well as the Risk Assessment in ts email. If you have any further question you can always contact me. Thank you. 

 

Yours sincerely, 

Cheng Wei Xuan

For the pasting of the wteboards, could you use blu tac (wte) instead of the original blue color so t will not be seen from inside the classroom wch could be unsightly. 

 

If you cannot find the wte tac, OCIF suggested to paste wte papers from inside the classroom instead to cover the blu tac. Do let us know your preferred arrangements or you may call me to clarify further. 

 

Hope to hear from you soon. Thank you.

To Crystal,

 

Good afternoon, I am writing ts email to request if we can start our online event earlier. As the online padlet has been approved, our team would like to request if we can start it on Week 9 (8th November Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 26th November) instead on Week 10 as we feel like running the event for a longer period will be more impactful. Looking forward to your reply.

 Wei Xuan,

 

For the email draft, if you intend to send ts out before the physical wteboard section is cleared, you may want to indicate that ts is still TBC at ts point of time.

 

We do not have TVs for loan. The 2 weeksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ timeline includes the process of vetting of videos, editing (if any) and clearance for the use of campus TV wch involves multiple departments Ã¢â‚¬â€œ OSL, Marketing, OCIF and IT. The timeline is actually quite reasonable and if all clearance can be obtained earlier, I will definitely inform you on that.

 Requesting for an event approval for Week 11 

 

To Office of Student Life and Events,

 

Good afternoon, I am Cheng Wei Xuan from ROOT and I am writing ts email with  to requesting approval for my teamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s event. 

 

Our event (A Collage Network) aims to motivate students by allowing students to send motivational messages and images to each other. The event will be split into 2 parts, an online and a physical. For the online ponent, we will be allowing the entire school to send their encouragement here padlet/ROOT_Welfare3/t1f3ozzfypy278z2 <apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook/?url=%3A%2F%2Fpadlet%2FROOT_Welfare3%2Ft1f3ozzfypy278z2Students&data=04%7C01%7C_%40.sutd..%7Ca903e43bfa564f3d721708d9b2fcdf31%7C3476b776e9904f72b95062489831623d%7C0%7C0%7C637737621563175970%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=uRfv8ZSopatrGeNE095zKmjewKhvECp%2FRLnpcPFyQSM%3D&reserved=0> .

 

Students can see each other messages through the same link. We intend to have the online munity board up from 15th November to 26th of November (Week 10 and 11).  At the end of the event on the 26th of November, my team intends to make a video collage of all the messages written and to display the video collage on the TV in the school canteen. We will only be able to send you the video on the 28th of November. Therefore, I would also like to check if there is an estimate on how long it would take before the video can be displayed on the tv as I undersd that the video needs to be approved first. We would like to display the collage video until the 17th of December (Week 14) when finals are over.

 

For the physical ponent, it will be targeted to the Term 1  students. We would like to paste wteboard sheets onto each Term 1 Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s classroom doors such that t can decorate and write motivational messages for each other for class bonding and to motivate the cohort. I have attached a layout of where we will be pasting the wteboard sheets in ts email. We would like to leave the wteboards from Week 11 till Week 14 until finals are over.

 

I've attached the Event Proposal Form as well as the Risk Assessment in ts email. If you have any further question you can always contact me. Thank you. 

 

Yours sincerely, 

Cheng Wei Xuan

 Crystal,

 

Thank you so much for the quick response and kind undersding.

 

HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s my response to your questions:

*	The whole event including the online session is actually held physically where students gather at their respective venue. Is ts correct? Yes ts will be a physical event held in tnk k. Including the introduction, t will be sitting in the room watcng the video call held in Teams.
*	The activity is mainly Q&A (from the card) and interaction between seniors and juniors, no games right? Yes too, no games will be involve and we will keep it as a session for juniors to get to know their new mittee. 
*	I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really undersd the fifth row session hence not collecting PDPA. Do you mean ts event is by invite only and not open for sign up so there will be no registration form or collecting of PDPA? Yup, ts event is only open to ROOT club members (i.e. the cabinet, secretary, directors). As it is not open to school like an organised event, we will not be having a sign up form. We will just be taking attendance on the day. 

 

WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re super grateful for your help. Hope to get the approval for ts session.

 

Yours sincerely,

 EPF: SPROOT (Sprouting ROOT) 

 

 Events and OSL,

 

I'm sure you've been experiencing an increase in EPF and RAF since Week 9, mainly from ROOT. We deeply apologize for that and thank you so much for helping us make our ideas e true (like fairy god mothers). Once again sorry because there's another event (more of fifth row session) ing up! 

 



 

To celebrate the end of the events planned by the ining ROOT batch, we will be hosting a SPROOT session to wele their arrival to the ROOT family. It will be a 1.5h event, with 30min online and 1h physical. Do refer to the EPF, RAF and the floor plan attached for more information.

 

With  to SMM, we will adhere to the following:

*	Participants will have to keep a safe disce of at least 1-metre from others.
*	If there is more than one group sharing a space, the groups must maintain at least a disce of 3-metres apart from one another at all times.
*	Students will only be allowed to participate in fifth row activities on the days when t are schled for classes on campus.
*	Students are subjected to the weekly ART testing and only students will valid negative ART results will be allowed to be back on campus.
*	Masks must be kept on at all times.

I undersd that lessons for Term 6 students may still be online. We will ensure that t have classes that day or is a hostel resident and that their ART is negative before allowing them to attend the physical session. If not, t will attend the virtual session only.

 

As ts is considered a fifth-row session from ROOT, we will not be collecting any data. Thus, no sign-up form and PDPA form required.

 

As for the venues, we are looking for 5 tnk ks for the 5 different mittee. We are looking at maximum 20 people in a room (including secretary, existing ROOT directors and ining ROOT directors). Numbers vary from different room due to the difference in size of mittee. We will confirm the attendance closer to the date.

 Request for Quotation 

 

 Sir/Madam, 

 

I am Devans from the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) Student Government. My team would like to seek your kind quotation for our event. 

 

We are looking for a simple wte cotton round neck, short sleeve srt with a simple (8cm * 8cm) logo printing in black ink on the sleeve or the front. As we are currently unsure on the potential numbers, we would like to seek 2 separate quotations, 1 for Qty: 300, 1 for Qty: 400. 

 

We would like to check the following details:

1. What is the accepted payment mode?

2. How long is the lead time from confirming the design and number per size to collection? 

3. Is delivery free?

 

Yours sincerely,

 

Devans Jos

 Request for Quotation 

 

 Sir/Madam, 

 

I am Devans from the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) Student Government. My team would like to seek your kind quotation for our event. 

 

We are looking for a simple wte cotton round neck, short sleeve srt with a simple (8cm * 8cm) logo printing in black ink on the sleeve or the front. As we are currently unsure on the potential numbers, we would like to seek 2 separate quotations, 1 for Qty: 300, 1 for Qty: 400. 

 

We would like to check the following details:

1. What is the accepted payment mode?

2. How long is the lead time from confirming the design and number per size to collection? 

3. Is delivery free?

 

Yours sincerely,

 

Devans Jos

 Request for Freshnomore T-shirt Purchase Award Form signature," Devans,

 

Thanks for the details. In that case, please get GM Sports and TJG to amend their quotation to reflect what you mentioned is indeed what t offer.

 

After that, please update the PAF as well and resubmit all documents for our review. If TJG requires 50% deposit, then it does seem reasonable to remend GM Sports although the latter cost slightly more.

 

Please note that moving forward, the quotation should reflect all these details for clarification purposes to avoid delays and mismunication :)

  Request for Freshnomore T-srt Purchase Award Form signature 

 

 Crystal,

 

I called GM Sports to confirm and t said that t are able to deliver the srts next week on the 6th or 7th December. 

 

I apologise for the reasoning, I am doing such a claim for the first time, I will keep ts in mind for future claims. GM was the supplier for the Stay Up Till Dawn srts so we have surety that t will deliver the products without any promise in the quality. Also, TJG require a 50% deposit to confirm the order and have a $20 delivery fee. Whereas, for GM we can pay by Cash, Giro or Cheque based on their quotation document.

 Devans,

 

GM Sports delivery is 30 working days from date of confirmation. Your team is ok with ts? The delivery will be in Jan 2022 if my calculation is correct.

 

For the PAF, please note that reason for remendation should not only be based on past purchase like it is a ""favourite"". What is the mode of payment for TJG Print? If ts is cash on delivery, then additional point for chossing GM sports could be that t provide 30 days payment term.

We are looking for a simple wte cotton round neck, short sleeve srt with a simple (8cm * 8cm) logo printing in black ink on the sleeve or the front. As we are currently unsure on the potential numbers, we would like to seek 2 separate quotations, 1 for Qty: 300, 1 for Qty: 400. 

 

We would like to check the following details:

1. What is the accepted payment mode?

2. How long is the lead time from confirming the design and number per size to collection? 

3. Is delivery free?

 

Yours sincerely,

 

Devans Jos

 Request for Freshnomore T-shirt Purchase Award Form signature," Devans,

GM Sports delivery is 30 working days from date of confirmation. Your team is ok with ts? The delivery will be in Jan 2022 if my calculation is correct.

For the PAF, please note that reason for remendation should not only be based on past purchase like it is a ""favourite"". What is the mode of payment for TJG Print? If ts is cash on delivery, then additional point for chossing GM sports could be that t provide 30 days payment term.

 Sir/Madam, 

 

I am Devans from the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) Student Government. My team would like to seek your kind quotation for our event. 

 

We are looking for a simple wte cotton round neck, short sleeve srt with a simple (8cm * 8cm) logo printing in black ink on the sleeve or the front. As we are currently unsure on the potential numbers, we would like to seek 2 separate quotations, 1 for Qty: 300, 1 for Qty: 400. 

 

We would like to check the following details:

1. What is the accepted payment mode?

2. How long is the lead time from confirming the design and number per size to collection? 

3. Is delivery free?

 

Yours sincerely,

 Crystal,

 

Thank you so much for the quick response and kind undersding.

 

HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s my response to your questions:

*	The whole event including the online session is actually held physically where students gather at their respective venue. Is ts correct? Yes ts will be a physical event held in tnk k. Including the introduction, t will be sitting in the room watcng the video call held in Teams.
*	The activity is mainly Q&A (from the card) and interaction between seniors and juniors, no games right? Yes too, no games will be involve and we will keep it as a session for juniors to get to know their new mittee. 
*	I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really undersd the fifth row session hence not collecting PDPA. Do you mean ts event is by invite only and not open for sign up so there will be no registration form or collecting of PDPA? Yup, ts event is only open to ROOT club members (i.e. the cabinet, secretary, directors). As it is not open to school like an organised event, we will not be having a sign up form. We will just be taking attendance on the day. 

 

WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re super grateful for your help. Hope to get the approval for ts session.

 

Yours sincerely,

 Events and OSL,

 

I'm sure you've been experiencing an increase in EPF and RAF since Week 9, mainly from ROOT. We deeply apologize for that and thank you so much for helping us make our ideas e true (like fairy god mothers). Once again sorry because there's another event (more of fifth row session) ing up! 

 



 

To celebrate the end of the events planned by the ining ROOT batch, we will be hosting a SPROOT session to wele their arrival to the ROOT family. It will be a 1.5h event, with 30min online and 1h physical. Do refer to the EPF, RAF and the floor plan attached for more information.

 

With  to SMM, we will adhere to the following:

*	Participants will have to keep a safe disce of at least 1-metre from others.
*	If there is more than one group sharing a space, the groups must maintain at least a disce of 3-metres apart from one another at all times.
*	Students will only be allowed to participate in fifth row activities on the days when t are schled for classes on campus.
*	Students are subjected to the weekly ART testing and only students will valid negative ART results will be allowed to be back on campus.
*	Masks must be kept on at all times.

I undersd that lessons for Term 6 students may still be online. We will ensure that t have classes that day or is a hostel resident and that their ART is negative before allowing them to attend the physical session. If not, t will attend the virtual session only.

 

As ts is considered a fifth-row session from ROOT, we will not be collecting any data. Thus, no sign-up form and PDPA form required.

 

As for the venues, we are looking for 5 tnk ks for the 5 different mittee. We are looking at maximum 20 people in a room (including secretary, existing ROOT directors and ining ROOT directors). Numbers vary from different room due to the difference in size of mittee. We will confirm the attendance closer to the date.

 Sir/Madam, 

 

I am Devans from the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) Student Government. My team would like to seek your kind quotation for our event. 

 

We are looking for a simple wte cotton round neck, short sleeve srt with a simple (8cm * 8cm) logo printing in black ink on the sleeve or the front. As we are currently unsure on the potential numbers, we would like to seek 2 separate quotations, 1 for Qty: 300, 1 for Qty: 400. 

 

We would like to check the following details:

1. What is the accepted payment mode?

2. How long is the lead time from confirming the design and number per size to collection? 

3. Is delivery free?

 

Yours sincerely,

 

Devans Jos

 Devans,

 

Can you clarify regarding the tsrt design fee? Is ts part of your specification in the purchase?

 

For quotations to be parable, t have to have the same specifications. GM did not specify there is a Ã¢â‚¬Å“tsrt design feeÃ¢â‚¬Â. So is the designing FOC or it is already part of the quotation? 

 

If tsrt design is part of the specifications, all the other quotes would need to include the design fee as well.

GM has sent the updated quotation after finalising the design and the number of srts wch is now 500. TJG has also sent the quotation for 500 srts with the delivery and terms for payment. TJGÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quotation is without the design hence it is expected to be gher than the amount t have stated. 

 

Kindly request the approval soon. I greatly apologise for the errors and mismunications. I will learn and keep the points you have mentioned in mind for future claims and purchases. 

 

Thank you. Have a nice day.

 Devans,

 

Thanks for the details. In that case, please get GM Sports and TJG to amend their quotation to reflect what you mentioned is indeed what t offer.

 

After that, please update the PAF as well and resubmit all documents for our review. If TJG requires 50% deposit, then it does seem reasonable to remend GM Sports although the latter cost slightly more.

 

Please note that moving forward, the quotation should reflect all these details for clarification purposes to avoid delays and mismunication :)

 Crystal,

 

I called GM Sports to confirm and t said that t are able to deliver the srts next week on the 6th or 7th December. 

 

I apologise for the reasoning, I am doing such a claim for the first time, I will keep ts in mind for future claims. GM was the supplier for the Stay Up Till Dawn srts so we have surety that t will deliver the products without any promise in the quality. Also, TJG require a 50% deposit to confirm the order and have a $20 delivery fee. Whereas, for GM we can pay by Cash, Giro or Cheque based on their quotation document.

 Devans,

 

GM Sports delivery is 30 working days from date of confirmation. Your team is ok with ts? The delivery will be in Jan 2022 if my calculation is correct.

 

For the PAF, please note that reason for remendation should not only be based on past purchase like it is a ""favourite"". What is the mode of payment for TJG Print? If ts is cash on delivery, then additional point for chossing GM sports could be that t provide 30 days payment term.

I am Devans Jos from ROOT Events. ROOT Events is carrng out the Freshnomore Event and for that we need to purchase Tsrts for the class of 2024. The cost of the Tsrts is above $1000 hence we would require approval to go ahead with the purchase.

Thank you. Have a good day.

I believe to start a fundraiser campaign, you will first need to sign up an account with giving.. May I know who is the account holder for ts campaign? How do you setup the account as Ã¢â‚¬Å“a batch of SUTD studentsÃ¢â‚¬Â?

 

My concern is that ts activity is proposed in the name of SUTD. Hence, the account should not be setup as an individual wch only the individual has access to the information relating to the campaign.

 

As ts is the first time we are exploring ts, we will need the specific details to review ts internally. Hope ts clarifies :)

 Crystal,

 

Here's the updated EPF. I've edited the finance segment and some details of how it will be held. As we will just be giving out the srts, no sign up form will be needed. We will get the srt size from the class chairpersons. 

 

For the donation part, I contacted CARE but didn't receive any reply so I am in contact with Cldren's Wisng Well <apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook/?url=%3A%2F%2Fwww.wisngwell.org.%2Fabout-us%2F%23whoweare&data=04%7C01%7C_%40.sutd..%7C22c274e36f7d4edabae408d9b3355a4b%7C3476b776e9904f72b95062489831623d%7C0%7C0%7C637737863991775498%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=%2BRq2i6hFOsAncXbCksH51IXTN9WM7%2FdEzT8%2F3p71ixI%3D&reserved=0>  now.  T would take 1-2 working day to get back to me.

 

Thank you for the approval for SPROOT! Would like to check if the approval of Freshnomore event would e soon because there is a lead time of 1-2 weeks for the srt. Thank you!

 

Yours sincerely,

 Crystal,

 

Sorry for the unclear message. So, we will be proceeding with the t-srt purchase and give it out to the whole cohort for free with the Class of 2024 measurements. Ts is because we wish to make the event inclusive for all and not want anyone to feel left out because of the $2 fee.

 

To pensate for that, we wish to do a charity for Christmas as a batch. So, instead of pang $2 for the srts, we will share a donation link to the Class of 2024 as a token from out batch to the society ts festive season. Ts will be optional for all, with no restriction to donation amount and out of goodwill only. 

 

Hope ts clarifies.

 

Yours sincerely,

Sure, I will inform Arshad closer to the date. 

 

An update on the project is that we would be scrapping the collection of ine plan and instead do a batch donation instead. Like Rotaract's NKF Donation, we will lias with an organisation to get a giving. link for our batch to donate as a batch charity. Do update me on how we can make ts possible. Feel free to drop me a call at 97705194 for any discussions.

 

Any update on the approval for both SPROOT and Freshnomore Event? We would like to purchase the items as soon as possible. Thank you! 

 

Yours sincerely,

 Crystal,

 

Yes, the decorating of srts will occur during their break and free time on their own will. The main part on ROOT will just be handling the srt sale. So, it's fine to take it as a srt sale activity. 

 

No venue booking is required as no distribution booth will be set. However, my team will need ROOT Cove access on the collection day to store, sort and give the srts to the class rep. How many days in advance do I need to provide the name list for access? 6 Dec on the EPF is tentative as I would need the approval of the event, to purchase the srt then can I confirm with the vendor with  to the collection.

 

Thank you so much! Have a great Tuesday Ã°Å¸â„¢â€š

 

Yours sincerely,

As we are unable to monitor the Ã¢â‚¬Å“eventÃ¢â‚¬Â since participants is given OTOT to get their friends to design their tsrts, I tnk I will review ts as sales of tsrt activity instead of an event. It seems that there will be no venue booking as well since there will be no distribution booth for the tsrt or specific venue for students to design the tsrt. Please let me know if ts is ok.

 Events and OSL,

 

To celebrate the end of  term, we would be having a decorating srt event for the Term 3 SUTDents in Week 13-14 (because we can't have BBQ sadly). Ts idea is inspired by the signing on uniforms on the last day of secondary school. However, as we do not have uniforms, we will be giving wte srts out at $2 each. As the cost for 400 t-srts is more than $1k, my team have sent out quotation requests to different panies and would include it when requesting the purchase.

 



 

If we can get approval by next week and proceed with the sign-up form and purchase in time, here would be the ine collection details.

 

Details of ine collection: 

Start date of collection: 26 November 2021

End date of collection: 29 November 2021

Submit Wallet User(s) details 

Full Name (as per NRIC): Devans Jos 

Email (SUTD): 1005162 <mail1005162>  

Mobile Number: 93821256

 

We will adhere to the current SMM:

*	There should be at least 1-metre disce between individuals, or if ts is not possible, at least 2m discing between groups of no more than 5 persons for mask-on general activities. 

*	Attendance of each activity will be submitted to staff advisor witn the next day.  

*	No food and drink are to be supplied or consumed witn the activity area to ensure masks remain on (apart from bottled water). 

 

After confirming the collection date for the srts, I would send the names of the people helping at ROOT Cove to collect the srts and distribute to the class reps.

 

Hope to get your approval. Feel free to contact me at 97705194 for any clarification. 

 

Yours sincerely,

"
 Request for Freshnomore T-shirt Purchase Award Form signature," Devans,

 

Can you clarify regarding the tsrt design fee? Is ts part of your specification in the purchase?

 

For quotations to be parable, t have to have the same specifications. GM did not specify there is a Ã¢â‚¬Å“tsrt design feeÃ¢â‚¬Â. So is the designing FOC or it is already part of the quotation? 

 

If tsrt design is part of the specifications, all the other quotes would need to include the design fee as well.

GM has sent the updated quotation after finalising the design and the number of srts wch is now 500. TJG has also sent the quotation for 500 srts with the delivery and terms for payment. TJGÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quotation is without the design hence it is expected to be gher than the amount t have stated. 

 

Kindly request the approval soon. I greatly apologise for the errors and mismunications. I will learn and keep the points you have mentioned in mind for future claims and purchases.

Thanks for the details. In that case, please get GM Sports and TJG to amend their quotation to reflect what you mentioned is indeed what t offer.

 

After that, please update the PAF as well and resubmit all documents for our review. If TJG requires 50% deposit, then it does seem reasonable to remend GM Sports although the latter cost slightly more.

 

Please note that moving forward, the quotation should reflect all these details for clarification purposes to avoid delays and mismunication :)

I apologise for the reasoning, I am doing such a claim for the first time, I will keep ts in mind for future claims. GM was the supplier for the Stay Up Till Dawn srts so we have surety that t will deliver the products without any promise in the quality. Also, TJG require a 50% deposit to confirm the order and have a $20 delivery fee. Whereas, for GM we can pay by Cash, Giro or Cheque based on their quotation document.

GM Sports delivery is 30 working days from date of confirmation. Your team is ok with ts? The delivery will be in Jan 2022 if my calculation is correct.

 

For the PAF, please note that reason for remendation should not only be based on past purchase like it is a ""favourite"". What is the mode of payment for TJG Print? If ts is cash on delivery, then additional point for chossing GM sports could be that t provide 30 days payment term.

 Crystal,

 

Here's the updated EPF. I've edited the finance segment and some details of how it will be held. As we will just be giving out the srts, no sign up form will be needed. We will get the srt size from the class chairpersons. 

 

For the donation part, I contacted CARE but didn't receive any reply so I am in contact with Cldren's Wisng Well <apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook/?url=%3A%2F%2Fwww.wisngwell.org.%2Fabout-us%2F%23whoweare&data=04%7C01%7C_%40.sutd..%7Cf232c3e456c1457b2d0308d9b31dac69%7C3476b776e9904f72b95062489831623d%7C0%7C0%7C637737762289141970%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=%2Fo8GR3EkTNLdFEVdE%2Br4loZOJpk6IC2UstISIEUC3cA%3D&reserved=0>  now.  T would take 1-2 working day to get back to me.

 

Thank you for the approval for SPROOT! Would like to check if the approval of Freshnomore event would e soon because there is a lead time of 1-2 weeks for the srt. Thank you!

 

Yours sincerely,

 Crystal,

 

Sorry for the unclear message. So, we will be proceeding with the t-srt purchase and give it out to the whole cohort for free with the Class of 2024 measurements. Ts is because we wish to make the event inclusive for all and not want anyone to feel left out because of the $2 fee.

 

To pensate for that, we wish to do a charity for Christmas as a batch. So, instead of pang $2 for the srts, we will share a donation link to the Class of 2024 as a token from out batch to the society ts festive season. Ts will be optional for all, with no restriction to donation amount and out of goodwill only. 

 

Hope ts clarifies.

 

Yours sincerely,

 Crystal,

 

Yes, the decorating of srts will occur during their break and free time on their own will. The main part on ROOT will just be handling the srt sale. So, it's fine to take it as a srt sale activity. 

 

No venue booking is required as no distribution booth will be set. However, my team will need ROOT Cove access on the collection day to store, sort and give the srts to the class rep. How many days in advance do I need to provide the name list for access? 6 Dec on the EPF is tentative as I would need the approval of the event, to purchase the srt then can I confirm with the vendor with  to the collection.

 

Thank you so much! Have a great Tuesday Ã°Å¸â„¢â€š

 

Yours sincerely,

As we are unable to monitor the Ã¢â‚¬Å“eventÃ¢â‚¬Â since participants is given OTOT to get their friends to design their tsrts, I tnk I will review ts as sales of tsrt activity instead of an event. It seems that there will be no venue booking as well since there will be no distribution booth for the tsrt or specific venue for students to design the tsrt. Please let me know if ts is ok.

 Events and OSL,

 

To celebrate the end of  term, we would be having a decorating srt event for the Term 3 SUTDents in Week 13-14 (because we can't have BBQ sadly). Ts idea is inspired by the signing on uniforms on the last day of secondary school. However, as we do not have uniforms, we will be giving wte srts out at $2 each. As the cost for 400 t-srts is more than $1k, my team have sent out quotation requests to different panies and would include it when requesting the purchase.

 



 

If we can get approval by next week and proceed with the sign-up form and purchase in time, here would be the ine collection details.

 

Details of ine collection: 

Start date of collection: 26 November 2021

End date of collection: 29 November 2021

Submit Wallet User(s) details 

Full Name (as per NRIC): Devans Jos 

Email (SUTD): 1005162 <mail1005162>  

Mobile Number: 93821256

 

We will adhere to the current SMM:

*	There should be at least 1-metre disce between individuals, or if ts is not possible, at least 2m discing between groups of no more than 5 persons for mask-on general activities. 

*	Attendance of each activity will be submitted to staff advisor witn the next day.  

*	No food and drink are to be supplied or consumed witn the activity area to ensure masks remain on (apart from bottled water). 

 

After confirming the collection date for the srts, I would send the names of the people helping at ROOT Cove to collect the srts and distribute to the class reps.

 

Hope to get your approval. Feel free to contact me at 97705194 for any clarification. 

 

Yours sincerely,

 Sir/Madam, 

 

I am Devans from the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) Student Government. My team would like to seek your kind quotation for our event. 

 

We are looking for a simple wte cotton round neck, short sleeve srt with a simple (8cm * 8cm) logo printing in black ink on the sleeve or the front. As we are currently unsure on the potential numbers, we would like to seek 2 separate quotations, 1 for Qty: 300, 1 for Qty: 400. 

 

We would like to check the following details:

1. What is the accepted payment mode?

2. How long is the lead time from confirming the design and number per size to collection? 

3. Is delivery free?

 

Yours sincerely,

  Request for Freshnomore T-srt Purchase Award Form signature 

 

 Devans,

 

Can you clarify regarding the tsrt design fee? Is ts part of your specification in the purchase?

 

For quotations to be parable, t have to have the same specifications. GM did not specify there is a Ã¢â‚¬Å“tsrt design feeÃ¢â‚¬Â. So is the designing FOC or it is already part of the quotation? 

 

If tsrt design is part of the specifications, all the other quotes would need to include the design fee as well.

 Crystal,

 

GM has sent the updated quotation after finalising the design and the number of srts wch is now 500. TJG has also sent the quotation for 500 srts with the delivery and terms for payment. TJGÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quotation is without the design hence it is expected to be gher than the amount t have stated. 

 

Kindly request the approval soon. I greatly apologise for the errors and mismunications. I will learn and keep the points you have mentioned in mind for future claims and purchases. 

 

Thank you. Have a nice day.

  Request for Freshnomore T-srt Purchase Award Form signature 

 

 Devans,

 

Thanks for the details. In that case, please get GM Sports and TJG to amend their quotation to reflect what you mentioned is indeed what t offer.

 

After that, please update the PAF as well and resubmit all documents for our review. If TJG requires 50% deposit, then it does seem reasonable to remend GM Sports although the latter cost slightly more.

 

Please note that moving forward, the quotation should reflect all these details for clarification purposes to avoid delays and mismunication :)

  Request for Freshnomore T-srt Purchase Award Form signature 

 

 Crystal,

 

I called GM Sports to confirm and t said that t are able to deliver the srts next week on the 6th or 7th December. 

 

I apologise for the reasoning, I am doing such a claim for the first time, I will keep ts in mind for future claims. GM was the supplier for the Stay Up Till Dawn srts so we have surety that t will deliver the products without any promise in the quality. Also, TJG require a 50% deposit to confirm the order and have a $20 delivery fee. Whereas, for GM we can pay by Cash, Giro or Cheque based on their quotation document.

  Request for Freshnomore T-srt Purchase Award Form signature 

 

 Devans,

 

GM Sports delivery is 30 working days from date of confirmation. Your team is ok with ts? The delivery will be in Jan 2022 if my calculation is correct.

 

For the PAF, please note that reason for remendation should not only be based on past purchase like it is a ""favourite"". What is the mode of payment for TJG Print? If ts is cash on delivery, then additional point for chossing GM sports could be that t provide 30 days payment term.

 Request for Freshnomore T-srt Purchase Award Form signature 

 

 Crystal,

 

I am Devans Jos from ROOT Events. ROOT Events is carrng out the Freshnomore Event and for that we need to purchase Tsrts for the class of 2024. The cost of the Tsrts is above $1000 hence we would require approval to go ahead with the purchase.

 

Attached are the formal quotations from various Tsrt panies and the Purchase Award Form requiring your signature for approval. 

 

Thank you. Have a good day.

 Siti, 

 

Thanks for the declared list and venue approval.

 

For the event, most department had majority of the mittee members around and so t were able to get to know the newly joined directors. It started off a little awkward for most, but because we've met one another online for BROOT GROOT before, everyone quickly adapted and bonded well. In general,  the event went well, and everyone was happy to meet each other physically. Ts couldn't be made possible, without the help of OSL. Thus, we would like to thank your great support. Hope to work with you for more events. 

 

Yours sincerely,

 Crystal,

 

Thank you so much for the quick response and kind undersding.

 

HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s my response to your questions:

*	The whole event including the online session is actually held physically where students gather at their respective venue. Is ts correct? Yes ts will be a physical event held in tnk k. Including the introduction, t will be sitting in the room watcng the video call held in Teams.
*	The activity is mainly Q&A (from the card) and interaction between seniors and juniors, no games right? Yes too, no games will be involve and we will keep it as a session for juniors to get to know their new mittee. 
*	I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really undersd the fifth row session hence not collecting PDPA. Do you mean ts event is by invite only and not open for sign up so there will be no registration form or collecting of PDPA? Yup, ts event is only open to ROOT club members (i.e. the cabinet, secretary, directors). As it is not open to school like an organised event, we will not be having a sign up form. We will just be taking attendance on the day. 

 

WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re super grateful for your help. Hope to get the approval for ts session.

 

Yours sincerely,

 EPF: SPROOT (Sprouting ROOT) 

 

 Events and OSL,

 

I'm sure you've been experiencing an increase in EPF and RAF since Week 9, mainly from ROOT. We deeply apologize for that and thank you so much for helping us make our ideas e true (like fairy god mothers). Once again sorry because there's another event (more of fifth row session) ing up! 

 



 

To celebrate the end of the events planned by the ining ROOT batch, we will be hosting a SPROOT session to wele their arrival to the ROOT family. It will be a 1.5h event, with 30min online and 1h physical. Do refer to the EPF, RAF and the floor plan attached for more information.

 

With  to SMM, we will adhere to the following:

*	Participants will have to keep a safe disce of at least 1-metre from others.
*	If there is more than one group sharing a space, the groups must maintain at least a disce of 3-metres apart from one another at all times.
*	Students will only be allowed to participate in fifth row activities on the days when t are schled for classes on campus.
*	Students are subjected to the weekly ART testing and only students will valid negative ART results will be allowed to be back on campus.
*	Masks must be kept on at all times.

I undersd that lessons for Term 6 students may still be online. We will ensure that t have classes that day or is a hostel resident and that their ART is negative before allowing them to attend the physical session. If not, t will attend the virtual session only.

 

As ts is considered a fifth-row session from ROOT, we will not be collecting any data. Thus, no sign-up form and PDPA form required.

 

As for the venues, we are looking for 5 tnk ks for the 5 different mittee. We are looking at maximum 20 people in a room (including secretary, existing ROOT directors and ining ROOT directors). Numbers vary from different room due to the difference in size of mittee. We will confirm the attendance closer to the date.

  Enquiry on Term 3 Fund 

 

 ,

 

We have previously email to all Chair and Deputy Chair after the end of Term 2 to inform all about the change in cohort advisor and the matters of the class funds. Each class can claim $250. Process is the same. However you need to email me for approval before proceeding with the purchase and claims.

 

Thanks.

 Bee Foong,

 

Previously, you shared with me that Term 3 will have class fund but we didn't receive any official notification or how to do so.

 

Can I clarify on how can we claim the $250 and do we need to seek approval from anyone?

 

Yours sincerely,

I believe to start a fundraiser campaign, you will first need to sign up an account with giving.. May I know who is the account holder for ts campaign? How do you setup the account as Ã¢â‚¬Å“a batch of SUTD studentsÃ¢â‚¬Â?

 

My concern is that ts activity is proposed in the name of SUTD. Hence, the account should not be setup as an individual wch only the individual has access to the information relating to the campaign.

 

As ts is the first time we are exploring ts, we will need the specific details to review ts internally. Hope ts clarifies :)

 Crystal,

 

Here's the updated EPF. I've edited the finance segment and some details of how it will be held. As we will just be giving out the srts, no sign up form will be needed. We will get the srt size from the class chairpersons. 

 

For the donation part, I contacted CARE but didn't receive any reply so I am in contact with Cldren's Wisng Well <apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook/?url=%3A%2F%2Fwww.wisngwell.org.%2Fabout-us%2F%23whoweare&data=04%7C01%7C_%40.sutd..%7C46f4c5fe679c4ca4589408d9b3da3c7b%7C3476b776e9904f72b95062489831623d%7C0%7C0%7C637738572177802201%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=uSEV4eZ0pdOI%2F6WjTzjVRs9JtoikmhDItubND4kzSnE%3D&reserved=0>  now.  T would take 1-2 working day to get back to me.

 

Thank you for the approval for SPROOT! Would like to check if the approval of Freshnomore event would e soon because there is a lead time of 1-2 weeks for the srt. Thank you!

 

Yours sincerely,

 Crystal,

 

Sorry for the unclear message. So, we will be proceeding with the t-srt purchase and give it out to the whole cohort for free with the Class of 2024 measurements. Ts is because we wish to make the event inclusive for all and not want anyone to feel left out because of the $2 fee.

 

To pensate for that, we wish to do a charity for Christmas as a batch. So, instead of pang $2 for the srts, we will share a donation link to the Class of 2024 as a token from out batch to the society ts festive season. Ts will be optional for all, with no restriction to donation amount and out of goodwill only. 

 

Hope ts clarifies.

 

Yours sincerely,

 Crystal,

 

Yes, the decorating of srts will occur during their break and free time on their own will. The main part on ROOT will just be handling the srt sale. So, it's fine to take it as a srt sale activity. 

 

No venue booking is required as no distribution booth will be set. However, my team will need ROOT Cove access on the collection day to store, sort and give the srts to the class rep. How many days in advance do I need to provide the name list for access? 6 Dec on the EPF is tentative as I would need the approval of the event, to purchase the srt then can I confirm with the vendor with  to the collection.

 

Thank you so much! Have a great Tuesday Ã°Å¸â„¢â€š

 

Yours sincerely,

As we are unable to monitor the Ã¢â‚¬Å“eventÃ¢â‚¬Â since participants is given OTOT to get their friends to design their tsrts, I tnk I will review ts as sales of tsrt activity instead of an event. It seems that there will be no venue booking as well since there will be no distribution booth for the tsrt or specific venue for students to design the tsrt. Please let me know if ts is ok.

 EPF: Freshnomore Event

 

 Events and OSL,

 

To celebrate the end of  term, we would be having a decorating srt event for the Term 3 SUTDents in Week 13-14 (because we can't have BBQ sadly). Ts idea is inspired by the signing on uniforms on the last day of secondary school. However, as we do not have uniforms, we will be giving wte srts out at $2 each. As the cost for 400 t-srts is more than $1k, my team have sent out quotation requests to different panies and would include it when requesting the purchase.

 



 

If we can get approval by next week and proceed with the sign-up form and purchase in time, here would be the ine collection details.

 

Details of ine collection: 

Start date of collection: 26 November 2021

End date of collection: 29 November 2021

Submit Wallet User(s) details 

Full Name (as per NRIC): Devans Jos 

Email (SUTD): 1005162 <mail1005162>  

Mobile Number: 93821256

 

We will adhere to the current SMM:

*	There should be at least 1-metre disce between individuals, or if ts is not possible, at least 2m discing between groups of no more than 5 persons for mask-on general activities. 

*	Attendance of each activity will be submitted to staff advisor witn the next day.  

*	No food and drink are to be supplied or consumed witn the activity area to ensure masks remain on (apart from bottled water). 

 

After confirming the collection date for the srts, I would send the names of the people helping at ROOT Cove to collect the srts and distribute to the class reps.

 

Hope to get your approval. Feel free to contact me at 97705194 for any clarification. 

 

Yours sincerely,
